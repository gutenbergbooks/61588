<p><strong>TRANSCRIBER’S NOTE</strong></p>

<p>The original text used the long-form s; this has been replaced by
the normal s in the etext.</p>

<p>The original text printed ‘ct’ as a ligature, and is displayed
simply as ‘ct’ character pair in the etext.</p>

<p>Fractions are displayed as
<span class="blkb fs120">
  <span class="blka">a.</span>
  <span class="blka over">b.</span>
</span>, for example
<span class="blkb fs120">
  <span class="blka">3.</span>
  <span class="blka over">4.</span>
</span>, similar to the format of the original text.</p>

<p>Whole numbers are always terminated with a period, as in the original text,
for example ‘about 1800. is the number of ... ’.</p>

<p>The pound currency sign in the text is l, which looks very similar to the number 1,
and the five occurrences have been italicized in the etext. For example
one hundred pounds is shown as 100<em>l.</em>, instead of 100l.</p>

<p>All changes listed in the <a href="#Errata">Errata</a> at the back of the book have been
applied to the etext. These changes are marked in the etext with
dashed green underlining.</p>

<p>Some other minor changes to the text are noted at <a href="#TN">the end of the book</a>.</p>

<p class="drop-cap">Young and vain persons, though perhaps
they marry not primarily and
onely on purpose to get Children,
much less to get such as may be fit
for some one particular vocation; yet having
Children, they dispose of them as well as they
can according to their respective inclinations:
Even so, although I wrote these sheets but to rid
my head of so many troublesome conceits, and
not to apply them to the use of any one particular
People or Concernment; yet now they are
born, and that their Birth happened to be about
the time of the <em>Duke of Ormond’s</em> going Lord
Lieutenant into <em>Ireland</em>, I thought they might be
as proper for the consideration of that place, as
of any other, though perhaps of effect little
enough in any.</p>

<p><em>Ireland</em> is a place which must have so great an
Army kept up in it, as may make the Irish desist
from doing themselves or the English harm by
their future Rebellions. And this great Army
must occasion great and heavy Leavies upon a
poor people and wasted Countrey; it is therefore
not amiss that <em>Ireland</em> should understand the
nature and measure of Taxes and Contributions.</p>

<p>2. The Parishes of <em>Ireland</em> do much want Regulation,
by uniting and dividing them; so as
to make them fit Enclosures wherein to plant
the Gospel: wherefore what I have said as to the
danger of supernumerary Ministers, may also be
seasonable there, when the new Geograpy we
expect of that Island shall have afforded means
for the Regulation abovementioned.</p>

<p>3. The great plenty of <em>Ireland</em> will but undo
it, unless a way be found for advantageous Exportations,
the which will depend upon the due
measure of Custom and Excize here treated on.</p>

<p>4. Since <em>Ireland</em> is under-peopled in the
whole, and since the Government there can never
be safe without chargeable Armies, until the
major part of the Inhabitants be English, whether
by carrying over these, or withdrawing
the other; I think there can be no better encouragement
to draw English thither, then to
let them know, that the Kings Revenue being
above
<span class="blkb">
  <span class="blka">1.</span>
  <span class="blka over">10.</span>
</span> part of the whole Wealth, Rent, and
Proceed of the Nation; that the Publick Charge
in the next Age will be no more felt there then
that of Tythes is here; and that as the Kings
Revenue encreases, so the causes of his Expence
will decrease proportionably, which is a double
advantage.</p>

<p>6. The employing the Beggars in <em>England</em>
about mending the High-wayes, and making
Rivers Navigable will make the Wool and Cattle
of <em>Ireland</em> vend the better.</p>

<p>7. The full understanding of the nature of
Money, the effects of the various <em>species</em> of
Coins, and of their uncertain values, as also of
raising or embasing them, is a learning most proper
for <em>Ireland</em>, which hath been lately much and
often abused for the want of it.</p>

<p>8. Since Lands are worth but six or seven years
purchase, and yet twenty years just cross the
Channel, ’twere good the people of <em>Ireland</em>
knew the reasons of it at a time when there is
means of help.</p>

<p>Lastly, if any man hath any Notions which probably
may be good for <em>Ireland</em>, he may with most
advantage expose them to publick examination
now, when the Duke of <em>Ormond</em> is Chief Governour:
for,</p>

<p>1. His Grace knows that Countrey perfectly
well, as well in times and matters of Peace as
War, and understands the Interests as well of
particular persons, as of all and every factions
and parties struggling with each other in that
Kingdom; understanding withall the state of
<em>England</em>, and also of several Forreign Nations,
with reference to <em>Ireland</em>.</p>

<p>2. His Grace hath given fresh demonstration of
his care of an English Interest in <em>Ireland</em>, and of his
wisdom in reconciling the several cross concernments
there so far as the same is possible.</p>

<p>3. His Graces Estate in Lands there is the greatest
that ever was in <em>Ireland</em>, and consequently he
is out of the danger incident to those <em>Proreges</em>,
against whom <em>Cambden</em> sayes, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Hibernia est semper
querula</i>; there being no reason for ones getting
more Land, who hath already the most of any.</p>

<p>4. Whereas some chief Governours who have
gone into <em>Ireland</em>, chiefly to repair or raise fortunes,
have withdrawn themselves again when
their work hath been done, not abiding the clamors
and complaints of the people afterwards:
But his Grace hath given Hostages to that Nation
for his good Government, and yet hath taken
away aforehand all fears of the contrary.</p>

<p>5. His Grace dares do whatever he understands
to be fitting, even to the doing of a single Subject
Justice against a Confederate multitude; being
above the sinister interpretations of the jealous
and querulous; for his known Liberality and
Magnificence shall ever keep him free from the
clamor of the people, and his through-tried fidelity
shall frustrate the force of any subdolous
whisperings in the Ears of His Majesty.</p>

<p>6. His good <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'acceptance ofall'">acceptance of all</ins> ingenious endeavours,
shall make the wise men of this Eastern
<em>England</em> be led by his Star into <em>Ireland</em>, and there
present him with their choicest advices, who can
most judiciously select and apply them.</p>

<p>Lastly, this great Person takes the great Settlement
in hand, when <em>Ireland</em> is as a white paper,
when there sits a Parliament most affectionate to
his Person, and capable of his Counsel, under a
King curious as well as careful of Reformation;
and when there is opportunity, to pass into Positive
Laws whatsoever is right reason and the
Law of Nature.</p>

<p>Wherefore by applying those Notions unto
<em>Ireland</em>, I think I have harped upon the right
string, and have struck whilest the Iron is hot;
by publishing them now, when, if ever at all,
they be useful. I would now advertise the
world, that I do not think I can mend it, and that
I hold it best for every mans particular quiet, to
let it <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">vadere sicut vult</i>; I know well, that <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">res
nolunt male administrari</i>, and that (say I what I
will or can) things will have their course, nor
will nature be couzened: Wherefore what I
have written (as I said before) was done but to
ease and deliver my self, my head having been
impregnated with these things by the daily talk
I hear about advancing and regulating Trade,
and by the murmurs about Taxes, &amp;c. Now
whether what I have said be contemned or cavilled
at, I care not, being of the same minde about
this, as some thriving men are concerning the
profuseness of their Children; for as they take
pleasure to get even what they believe will be
afterwards pissed against the wall, so do I to
write, what I suspect will signifie nothing:
Wherefore the race being not to the swift, &amp;c.
but time and chance happening to all men, I
leave the Judgement of the whole to the Candid,
of whose correction I shall never be impatient.</p>

<span class="fs70 lsp"><em>Of the several sorts of Publick Charges.</em></span></h2>

<div><img class="drop-cap" src="images/i017dc.jpg" width="100" alt="" /></div>

<p class="drop-cap">The Publick Charges of a State, are, <em>That
of its Defence</em> by Land and Sea, of its
Peace at home and abroad, as also of its
honourable vindication from the injuries
of other States; all which we may call
the Charge of the Militia, which commonly
is in ordinary as great as any
other Branch of the whole; but extraordinary,
(that is, in time of War, or fear of War) is much
the greatest.</p>

<p>2. Another branch of the Publick Charge is, the Maintenance
of the Governours, Chief and Subordinate; I mean,
such not onely as spend their whole time in the Execution of
their respective Offices, but also <ins class="corrx" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Erratum applied">who have spent</ins> much in fitting
themselves as well with abilities to that end, as in begetting
an opinion in their Superiours of such their ability and trustworthiness.</p>

<p>3. Which Maintenance of the Governours is to be in such
a degree of plenty and splendour, as private Endeavours and
Callings seldom reach unto: To the end, that such Governours
may have the natural as well as the artificial Causes of
Power to act with.</p>

<p>4. For if a great multitude of men should call one of
their number King, unless this instituted Prince, appear in
greater visible splendour then others, can reward those that
obey and please him, and do the contrary to others; his Institution<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
signifies little, even although he chance to have greater
corporal or mental faculties, then any other of the number.</p>

<p>5. There be Offices which are but πἀρεργα, as Sheriffs, Justices
of the Peace, Constables, Churchwardens, &amp;c. which
men may attend without much prejudice to their ordinary
wayes of livelihood, and for which the honour of being trusted,
and the pleasure of being feared, hath been thought a
competent Reward.</p>

<p>6. Unto this head, the Charge of the administring Justice
may be referred, as well between man and man, as between
the whole State or Commonalty and particular members of
it; as well that of righting and punishing past injuries and
crimes, as of preventing the same in time to come.</p>

<p>7. A third branch of the Publick Charge is, that of the
<em>Pastorage of mens Souls</em>, and the guidance of their Consciences;
which, one would think (because it respects another
world, and but the particular interest of each man there)
should not be a publick Charge in this: Nevertheless if we
consider how easie it is to elude the Laws of man, to commit
unprovable crimes, to corrupt and divert Testimonies, to
wrest the sense and meaning of the Laws, &amp;c. there follows
a necessity of contributing towards a publick Charge, wherewith
to have men instructed in the Laws of God, that take
notice of evil thoughts and designs, and much more of secret
deeds, and that punisheth eternally in another world, what
man can but slightly chastise in this.</p>

<p>8. Now those who labour in this publick Service, must also
be maintained in a proportionable splendour; and must withall
have the means to allure men with some kinde of reward, even
in this life; forasmuch, as many heretofore followed even
Christ himself but for the Loaves he gave them.</p>

<p>9. Another Branch is, the Charge of <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'Schools and Universitities'">Schools and Universities</ins>,
especially for so much as they teach above <em>Reading,
Writing, and Arithmetick</em>; these being of particular use to
every man, as being helps and substitutes of Memory and Reason,
Reckoning being of the latter, as Writing and Reading
are of the former, for whether Divinity, &amp;c. ought<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
to be made a private Trade, is to me a question.</p>

<p>10. ’Tis true, that Schools and Colledges are now for the
most part but the Donations of particular men, or places
where particular men spend their money and time upon their
own private accounts; but no doubt it were not amiss, if the
end of them were to furnish all imaginable helps unto the
highest and fined Natural Wits, towards the discovery of Nature
in all its operations; in which sense they ought to be a
publick Charge: The which Wits should not be selected for
that work, according to the fond conceits of their own Parents
and Friends, (Crows that think their own Birds ever
fairest) but rather by the approbation of others more impartial;
such as they are, who pick from out of the Christians
Children the ablest Instruments and Support of the Turkish
Government. Of which Selections more hereafter.</p>

<p>11. Another Branch is, that of the <em>Maintenance of Orphans,
found and exposed Children</em>, which also are Orphans; as also
of Impotents of all sorts, and moreover such as want employment.</p>

<p>12. For the permitting of any to beg is a more chargeable
way of maintaining them whom the law of Nature will not
suffer to starve, where food may possibly be had: Besides, it is
unjust to let any starve, when we think it just to limit the wages
of the poor, so as they can lay up nothing against the
time of their impotency and want of work.</p>

<p>13. A last Branch may be, the Charge of High-wayes,
Navigable Rivers, Aquæducts, Bridges, Havens, and other
things of universal good and concernment.</p>

<p>14. Other Branches may be thought on, which let other
men either refer unto these, or adde over and above. For it
suffices for my purpose to have for the present set down these
the chief and most obvious of all the rest.</p>

<span class="chap-sum"><em>Of the Causes which encrease and aggravate the
several sorts of Publick Charges.</em></span></h2>


<p class="drop-capy">Having thus spoken of the several sorts of Publick Charges,
we shall next consider the Causes which encrease
them both in general and in particular.</p>

<p>Among the general Causes is, First, the unwillingness of
the people to pay them; arising from an opinion, that by delay
and reluctancy they may wholly avoid them, with a suspition
that what is imposed is too much, or that what is collected
is embezelled or ill expended, or that it is unequally leavied
and assessed. All these resolving into an unnecessary Charge
to collect them, and of forcing their Prince to hardships towards
the people.</p>

<p>2. Another Cause which aggravates Taxes is, the force of
paying them in money at a certain time, and not in commodities,
at the most convenient seasons.</p>

<p>3. Thirdly, Obscurities and doubts concerning the right
of imposing.</p>

<p>4. Fourthly, Scarcity of Money, and Confusion of Coins.</p>

<p>5. Fifthly, Fewness of people, especially of Labourers
and Artificers.</p>

<p>6. Sixthly, Ignorance of the numbers, Wealth and Trade
of the people, causing a needless repetition of the charge
and trouble of new additional Levies, in order to amend
mistakes.</p>

<p>7. As to particulars. The Causes of encreasing the Military
Charge are the same with those <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'that enrease Wars'">that encrease Wars</ins>, or
fear of Wars, which are Forreign or Civil.</p>

<p>8. An Offensive Forreign War is caused by many, and
those very various, secret, personal distastes coloured&mdash;&mdash;with
publick pretences; of which we can say nothing, but that the
common encouragement unto them particularly here in <em>England</em><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
is a false opinion, that our Countrey is full peopled, or
that if we wanted more Territory, we could take it with less
charge from our neighbours, then purchase it from the <em>Americans</em>;
and a mistake, that the greatness and glory of a Prince
lyeth rather in the extent of his Territory, then in the number,
art, and industry of his people, well united and governed.
And moreover, that it is more glorious to take from others
by fraud or rapine, then to gain ones self out of the bowels
of the Earth and Sea.</p>

<p>9. Now those States are free from Forreign Offensive
Wars (arising as abovesaid out of Personal and Private Causes)
where the chief Governours Revenue is but small, and
not sufficient to carry on such Wars, the which if they happen
to be begun, and so far carryed on, as to <ins class="corrx" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Erratum applied">want general</ins> Contributions,
then those who have the power to impose them, do
commonly enquire what private persons and Ends occasioned
the War, and so fall upon the Authors, rather then contribute
to the Effect; otherwise then to quench it.</p>

<p>10. Defensive Wars are caused from unpreparedness of the
offended State for War, as when defective Stores are served
into the Magazines by corrupt Officers at the rate of good;
when <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'Armies are fasly'">Armies are falsely</ins> Mustered; when Souldiers are either
Tenants or Servants to their Commanders, or else persons,
who for their Crimes or Debts, want protection from Justice;
when the Officers are ignorant of their business, and absent
from their Commands; and withal afraid to punish, because
unwilling to pay. Wherefore to be alwayes in a posture of
War at home, is the cheapest way to keep off War from
abroad.</p>

<p>11. The causes of Civil Wars here in <em>Europe</em> proceed very
much from Religion, <em>viz.</em> the punishing of Believers heterodox
from the Authorized way, in publike and open places,
before great multitudes of ignorant people, with loss of life,
liberty, and limbs, rather then by well proportioned tolerable
pecuniary mulcts, such as every conscientious Non-Conformist
would gladly pay, and Hypocrites by refusing, discover
themselves to be such.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span></p>

<p>12. Civil Wars are likewise caused by peoples fansying,
that their own uneasie condition may be best remedied by an
universal confusion; although indeed upon the upshot of such
disorders they shall probably be in a worse, even although
they survive and succeed, but more probably perish in the
contest.</p>

<p>13. Moreover, the peoples believing that Forms of Government
shall in a few years produce any considerable alteration as
to the wealth of the Subject that the Form which is most ancient
and present is not the best for the place; that any established
family or person is not better then any new pretender, or even
then the best Election that can be made; that Sovereignty is
invisible, and that it is not certainly annexed unto some certain
person or persons.</p>

<p>14. Causes of Civil War are also, that the Wealth of the
Nation is in too few mens hands, and that no certain means
are provided to keep all men from a necessity either to beg, or
steal, or be Souldiers.</p>

<p>Moreover, the allowing Luxury in some, whilst others <ins class="corrx" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Erratum applied">needlesly starve</ins>.</p>

<p>The dispensing of benefits upon casual and uncertain Motives,
the giving vaste Emoluments to persons and parties of
no certain visible merit. These are the things which cause animosities
among the totter-headed multitude, who are the tinder
that the sparks of a few Designers may easily inflame.</p>

<p>15. <ins class="corrx" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Erratum applied">One</ins> Cause of Publick Charge in matters of Religion,
<ins class="corrx" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Erratum applied">is</ins> the not having changed the limits of Parishes and Cures
with the Change of Religion from Popery, and with the
Changes in Plantation and Trade. For now when the Ministers
of the Gospel preach unto multitudes assembled in one
place, may not Parishes be bigger? that is, may not Flocks
be more numerous, then when every particular sheep was, as
heretofore, drest and shorn three or four times <em>per annum</em> by
Shrift. If there be in <em>England</em> and <em>Wales</em> but about five millions
of people, what needs more then 5000. Parishes? that
is 1000. Sheep under every Shepheard. Whereas in the middling
Parishes of <em>London</em> there are about 5000. souls in each.
Upon which account there needs be in <em>England</em> and <em>Wales</em><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
but a 1000. Parishes, whereas there are near 10000.</p>

<p>16. Now the saving of half the Parishes, would (reckoning
the benefices one with another, but at 100<em>l.</em> <em>per Annum</em> a
piece) save 500000<em>l.</em> Besides, when the number of Parochial
Parsons were halved, then there would need but half the present
number of Byshops, Deans and Chapters, Colledges and
Cathedralls, which perhaps would amount to two or three
hundred thousand pounds more: And yet the Church of God
would be more regularly served then now, and that without
prejudice to that sacred, ancient Order of Episcopacy, and
the way of their Maintenance by Tythes; and all this in a
method of greater Reformation and suitableness thereunto.</p>

<p>18. But suppose it be said, that in some wild Countreys, a
thousand people do not live in a less scope of ground then of
eight miles square. To which I answer, that there are few or
no such places, the largest Parishes I know, being not more
capacious then of three or four miles square, in which is no
difficulty, for the people to meet once a week at some central
place within that scope.</p>

<p>19. Moreover I say, that a Curate of small Learning, if of
good life, and duly Ordained, may officiate in four Chappels
of Ease every Sunday; and the Preacher, who indeed should
be a person of Learning and Eloquence, may preach every
other Sunday in every of the said Chappels, by preaching in
two of them one day, and in the other two, the other day:
And this with Catechizing, and Extra-Lectures upon the
Week-dayes, would perform as much as now is performed, and
as much as by the blessing of God is necessary to salvation;
for the yoak of Christ is easie, and his burthen light.</p>

<p>20. But to put an end to this doubt; I affirm, that if England
and Wales were cut out in parcels of three miles square,
there would be found few above four thousand such, of which
to make Parishes.</p>

<p>21. Now if it be said, that the Alienation of these Tythes
is Sacriledge; I answer, that if the same be employed to defend
the Church of God against the Turke and Pope, and the
Nations who adhere to them, it is not at all; or less, then to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
give
<span class="blkb">
  <span class="blka">3.</span>
  <span class="blka over">4.</span>
</span> of the same to the Wives and Children of the
Priests which were not in being when those allowances were
set forth?</p>

<p>21. If I had not an abhorrence from propounding the
lessening of the Church Means, I could say, that the retrenching
part of each remaining Parsons Tythes and Emoluments,
and leaving <ins class="corrx" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Erratum applied">them</ins> for part, to the free Contributions of
<ins class="corrx" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Erratum applied">their</ins> Flocks, were a way to promote the Gospel, and to give
less offence to such as think that their whole maintenance
should be made in that manner.</p>

<p>22. I might also say, that forasmuch as there be more Males
then Females in <em>England</em>, (the said disproportion <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">pro tanto</i>
hindering procreation) that it were good for the Ministers to
return to their Cælibat; or that none should be Ministers,
whilst they were married, it being easie among five millions
of people to finde out 5000. that could and would live single,
that is, one in a thousand: And then our unmarried Parson
might live as well with half, as now with the whole of his
Benefice.</p>

<p>23. Alwayes provided, that though the number of Parishes,
and the measure of Benefices were lessened, yet that the
same ought to be done without dammage to the present
Incumbents.</p>

<p>24. As for lessening the Charge of Offices relating to the
Government and the Law, the same will consist in abolishing
the superfluous, supernumerary, and antiquated; and withall,
in retrenching the Fees of others, to what the labour, art,
and trust of their respective employments do require. For
there be many Offices wholly executed by Deputies for small
wages, whereas the Masters of them have ten times as much,
although they know nothing either of what is done, or ought
to be done in the business.</p>

<p>25. Now such Surplusages as these should be either restored
unto the people who gave them unto the King, at a time
when those Fees made up but a just reward for the Officer; or
else the King keeping them still might take them for so much
toward the Publick Charge, but not give them away to stop<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
the importunate suits of any particular person, in whom and
in all his dependants, such benefits do but cause a laziness as to
the true original gain of the Nation, and themselves in particular,
together with a total negligence and ignorance of the
publick good.</p>

<p>26. Many are the particulars that might be instanced of this
kinde; but my aim not being to prejudice any man in particular,
I descend no lower, wishing onely that there might be
an universal Reformation of what length of time hath warped
awry, in which case no particular men are to be troubled;
for if all suffer, none suffers, and all men would be no poorer
then now they are if they should lose half their Estates; nor
would they be a whit the richer if the same were doubled, the
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Ratio formalis</i> of Riches lying rather in proportion then
quantity.</p>

<p>27. To lessen the charge of Universities, unto which I adde
the Inns of Court, which is not much, were to lessen the number
of the Students in Divinity, Law and Medicine, by lessening
the use of those Professions.</p>

<p>Now having spoken already of Divinity, I come next to the
Law, and say; that if Registers were kept of all mens Estates
in Lands, and of all the Conveyances of, and Engagements
upon them; and withal if publick Loan-Banks, Lombards,
or Banks of Credit upon deposited money, Plate, Jewels,
Cloth, Wooll, Silke, Leather, Linnen, Mettals, and other
durable Commodities, were erected, I cannot apprehend how
there could be above one tenth part of the Law-suits and
Writings, as now there are.</p>

<p>28. And moreover, if by accompt of the people, of their
Land and other wealth, the number of Lawyers and Scriveners
were adjusted, I cannot conceive how their should remain
above one hundredth part of what now are; forasmuch as I
have heard some affirm, that there be now ten times as many
as are even now necessary; and that there are now ten times
as many Law-suits, as upon the abovementioned Reformation,
there would be. It follows therefore, that upon the
whole there would not need one in a hundred of the present<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
number of Retainers to the Law, and Offices of Justice;
the occasions as well of crimes as injuries being so much retrenched.</p>

<p>29. As for Physicians, it is not hard by the help of the
observations which have been lately made upon the Bills of
Mortality, to know how many are sick in <em>London</em> by the number
of them that dye, and by the proportions of the City to
finde out the same of the Countrey; and by both, by the advice
of the learned Colledge of that Faculty to calculate how
many Physicians were requisite for the whole Nation, and
consequently, how many Students in that art to permit and
encourage; and lastly, having calculated these numbers,
to adoptate a proportion of Chyrurgeons, Apothecaries,
and Nurses to them, and so by the whole to cut off and extinguish
that infinite swarm of vain pretenders unto, and abusers
of that God-like Faculty, which of all Secular Employments
our Saviour himself after he began to preach engaged himself
upon.</p>

<p>30. Moreover, if it were agreed, what number of Divines,
Physicians, and Civilians (that is, of men bred in Universities)
were requisite to the publick service? As suppose 13000.
in the present way, and perhaps not above 6000. in that way
of Retrenchment which we propound; then supposing that
but one in forty dyes <em>per annum</em>, it follows that less then 350.
might suffice to be sent yearly out of the Universities: Where
supposing they stay five years one with another, it followeth
also that about 1800. is the number of Students fit to be allowed
in the Universities at a time; I mean, of such as intend
to make Learning their Trade and way of Livelihood.</p>

<p>31. I might intimate, that if 1800. Students were enough,
and that if there were 40000. Parish Children and Foundlings
in <em>England</em>, it were probable that one in twenty of them might
be of excellent wit and towardness.</p>

<p>Now since the Publick may dispose of these Children as
they please, and since there is Maintenance in both Universities
for above 1800. what if our Professors of Art were in this
manner selected and educated? But of this but <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">in transitu</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span></p>

<p>32. Hereunto may be added, that by reason of Loan Banks
aforementioned, whereby the Credits and Estates of all Dealers
may be known, and all the mysterious dangers of money
prevented, and that by good Accompts of our growth, Manufacture,
Consumption, and Importation, it might be known
how many Merchants were able to mannage the Exchange of
our superfluous Commodities with the same of other Countreys:
And also how many Retailers are needful to make the
subdistributions into every Village of this Nation, and to receive
back their superfluities. Upon these grounds I presume
a large proportion of these also might be retrenched, who
properly and originally earn nothing from the Publick, being
onely a kinde of Gamesters, that play with one another for
the labours of the poor; yielding of themselves no fruit at
all, otherwise then as veins and arteries, to distribute forth and
back the blood and nutritive juyces of the Body Politick,
namely the product of Husbandry and Manufacture.</p>

<p>33. Now if the numerous Offices and Fees relating to
the Government, Law, and Church, and if the number of
Divines, Lawyers, Physicians, Merchants, and Retailers were
also lessened, all which do receive great wages for little work
done to the Publick, with how much greater ease would
common expences be defrayed? and with how much more
equality would the same be assessed?</p>

<p>34. We enumerated six Branches of the Publick Charge,
and have slightly spoken how four of them might be lessened;
we come next to the other two Branches, whereof we shall rather
recommend the augmentation.</p>

<p>The first of these two Branches I call, generally speaking,
Care of the Poor, consisting of Receptacles for the aged,
blinde, lame, &amp;c. in health; Hospitals for noysome, chronical,
curable and uncurable, inward and outward Diseases.
With others for acute and contagious. Others for Orphans,
sound and exposed Children; of which latter sort none should
be refused, let the number be never so great, provided their
names, families, and relations were well concealed: The
choice of which Children being made at their being about eight<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
or ten years old, might afford the King the fittest Instruments
for all kinde of his Affairs, and be as firmly obliged to be his
faithful servants as his own natural Children.</p>

<p>35. This is no new nor rare thing, onely the neglect of it
in these Countreys, is rather to be esteemed a rare and new
project: Nor is it unknown what excellent fruits there have
been of this Institution, of which we shall say much more, upon
another occasion hereafter.</p>

<p>36. When all helpless and impotent Persons were thus provided
for, and the lazy and thievish restrained and punished by
the Minister of Justice, it follows now, that we finde out
certain constant Employments for all other indigent people,
who labouring according to the Rules upon them, may require
a sufficiency of food and raiment. Their Children also,
(if small and impotent) as aforesaid, being provided for
elsewhere.</p>

<p>37. But what shall these Employments be? I answer, such
as were reckoned as the sixth Branch of the Publick Expence,
<em>viz.</em> making all High-wayes so broad, firm, and eaven, as
whereby the charge and tedium of travelling and Carriages
may be greatly lessened. The cutting and scowring of Rivers
into Navigable; the planting of usefull Trees for
timber, delight, and fruit in convenient places.</p>

<p>The making of Bridges and Cawseys.</p>

<p>The working in Mines, Quarries, and Colleries.</p>

<p>The Manufactures of Iron, &amp;c.</p>

<p>38. I pitch upon all these particulars, first, as works wanting
in this Nation; secondly, as works of much labour, and little
art; and thirdly, as introductive of new Trades into <em>England</em>,
to supply that of Cloth, which we have almost totally lost.</p>

<p>In the next place it will be asked, who shall pay these men?
I answer, every body; for if there be 1000. men in a Territory,
and if 100. of these can raise necessary food and raiment
for the whole 1000. If 200. more, make as much commodities,
as other Nations will give either their commodities
or money for, and if 400. more be employed in the ornaments,
pleasure, and magnificence of the whole; if there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
be 200. Governours, Divines, Lawyers, Physicians, Merchants,
and Retailers, making in all 900. the question is, since
there is food enough for this supernumerary 100. also, how
they should come by it? whether by begging, or by stealing;
or whether they shall suffer themselves to starve, finding no
fruit of their begging, or being taken in their stealing be
put to death another way? Or whether they shall be given
away to another Nation that will take them? I think ’tis plain,
they ought neither to be starved, nor hanged, nor given away;
now if they beg, they may pine for hunger to day, and be
gorged and glutted to morrow, which will occasion Diseases
and evil habits, the same may be said of stealing; moreover,
perhaps they may get either by begging or stealing more then
will suffice them, which will for ever after indispose them to
labour, even upon the greatest occasion which may suddenly
and unexpectedly happen.</p>

<p>39. For all these Reasons, it will be certainly the safer way
to afford them the superfluity which would otherwise be lost
and wasted, or wantonly spent: Or in case there be no overplus,
then ’tis fit to retrench a little from the delicacy of
others feeding in quantity or quality; few men spending less
then double of what might suffice them as to the bare necessities
of nature.</p>

<p>40. Now as to the work of these supernumeraries, let it
be without expence of Foreign Commodities, and then ’tis
no matter if it be employed to build a useless Pyramid upon
<em>Salisbury Plain</em>, bring the Stones at <em>Stonehenge</em> to <em>Tower-Hill</em>,
or the like; for at worst this would keep their mindes to discipline
and obedience, and their bodies to a patience of more
profitable labours when need shall require it.</p>

<p>41. In the next place, as an instance of the usefulness of
what hath been propounded, I ask what benefit will the mending
of High-wayes, the building of Bridges and Cawseys,
with making of Rivers navigable produce, besides the pleasure
and beauty of them? To which I also answer, as an instance
of the premises, that the same, together with the numerous
millions of Cattle and Sheep out of <em>Ireland</em>, shall produce<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
a vaste superfluity of English Horses, the which because
they have the many excellent qualities of beauty, strength,
courage, swiftness, and patience concentrated in them, beyond
the Horses of other places, would be a very vendible
Commodity all over <em>Europe</em>; and such as depending upon the
intrinsick nature of the English Soyle could not be counterfeited,
nor taken away by others. Moreover, an Horse is such
a Commodity as will carry both himself and his Merchant to
the Market, be the same never so distant.</p>

<span class="chap-sum"><em>How the Causes of the unquiet bearing of
Taxes may be lessened.</em></span></h2>


<p class="drop-capy">We <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'have slighty gone'">have slightly gone</ins> through all the six Branches of
the Publick Charge, and have (though imperfectly
and in haste) shewn what would encrease, and what would
abate them.</p>

<p>We come next to take away some of the general Causes of
the unquiet bearing of Taxes, and yielding to Contributions,
<em>viz.</em></p>

<p>2. 1. That the people think, the Sovereign askes more
then he needs. To which we answer, 1. That if the
Sovereign were sure to have what he wanted in due time, it
were his own great dammage to draw away the money out of
his Subjects hands, who by trade increase it, and to hoard
it up in his own Coffers, where ’tis of no use even to himself,
but lyable to be begged or vainly expended.</p>

<p>3. 2. Let the Tax be never so great, if it be proportionable
unto all, then no man suffers the loss of any Riches by it.
For men (as we said but now) if the Estates of them all were
either halfed or doubled, would in both cases remain equally
rich. For they would each man have his former state, dignity, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
degree; and moreover, the Money leavied not going out of the
Nation, the same also would remain as rich in comparison of
any other Nation; onely the Riches of the Prince and People
would differ for a little while, namely, until the money leavied
from some, were again refunded upon the same, or other
persons that paid it: In which case every man also should
have his chance and opportunity to be made the better or
worse by the new distribution; or if he lost by one, yet to
gain by another.</p>

<p>4. 3. Now that which angers men most, is to be taxed
above their Neighbours. To which I answer, that many times
these surmizes are mistakes, many times they are chances, which
in the next Tax may run more favourable; and if they be by
design, yet it cannot be imagined, that it was by design of
the Sovereign, but of some temporary Assessor, whose turn
it may be to receive the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Talio</i> upon the next occasion from the
very man he has wronged.</p>

<p>5. 4. Men repine much, if they think the money leavyed
will be expended on Entertainments, <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'mangnificent Shews'">magnificent Shews</ins>, triumphal
Arches, &amp;c. To which I answer, that the same is a
refunding the said moneys to the Tradesmen who work upon
those things; which Trades though they seem vain and onely
of ornament, yet they refund presently to the most useful;
namely, to Brewers, Bakers, Taylours, Shoemakers, &amp;c.
Moreover, the Prince hath no more pleasure in these Shews
and Entertainments then 100000. others of his meanest Subjects
have, whom, for all their grumbling, we see to travel many
miles to be spectators of these mistaken and distasted vanities.</p>

<p>6. 5. The people often complain, that the King bestows the
money he raises from the people upon his Favourites: To
which we answer; that what is given to Favourites, may at the
next step or transmigration, come into our own hands, or
theirs unto whom we wish well, and think do deserve it.</p>

<p>7. Secondly, as this man is a Favourite to day, so another,
or our selves, may be hereafter; favour being of a very slippery
and moveable nature, and not such a thing as we need
much to envy; for the same way that&mdash;&mdash;leads up an hill,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
leads also down the same. Besides, there is nothing in the
Lawes or Customes of <em>England</em>, which excludes any the
meanest mans Childe, from arriving to the highest Offices in
this Kingdom, much less debars him from the Personall kindness
of his Prince.</p>

<p>8. All these imaginations (whereunto the vulgar heads are
subject) do cause a backwardness to pay, and that necessitates
the Prince to severity. Now this lighting upon some poor,
though stubborn, stiff-necked Refuser, charged with Wife and
Children, gives the credulous great occasion to complain of
Oppression, and breeds ill blood as to all other matters; feeding
the ill humours already in being.</p>

<p>9. 6. Ignorance of the Number, Trade, and Wealth of the
people, is often the reason why the said people are needlesly
troubled, viz. with the double charge and vexation of two, or
many Levies, when one might have served: Examples whereof
have been seen in late Poll-moneys; in which (by reason
of not knowing the state of the people, <em>viz.</em> how many there
were of each Taxable sort, and the want of sensible markes
whereby to rate men, and the confounding of Estates with
Titles and Offices) great mistakes were committed.</p>

<p>10. Besides, for not knowing the Wealth of the people,
the Prince knows not what they can bear; and for not knowing
the Trade, he can make no Judgment of the proper season
when to demand his Exhibitions.</p>

<p>11. 7. Obscurities and doubts, about the right of imposing,
hath been the cause of great and ugly Reluctancies in the
people, and of Involuntary Severities in the Prince; an
eminent Example whereof was the Ship-money, no small cause
of twenty years calamity to the whole Kingdom.</p>

<p>12. 8. Fewness of people, is real poverty; and a Nation
wherein are Eight Millions of people, are more then twice as
rich as the same scope of Land wherein are but Four; For the
same Governours which are the great charge, may serve near
as well, for the greater, as the lesser number.</p>

<p>13. Secondly, If the people be so few, as that they can live,
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Ex sponte Creatii</i>, or with little labour, such as is Grazing, &amp;c.,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
they become wholly without Art. No man that will not exercise
his hands, being able to endure the tortures of the
mind, which much thoughtfulness doth occasion.</p>

<p>14. 9. Scarcity of money, is another cause of the bad payment
of Taxes; for if we consider, that of all the wealth of
this Nation, <em>viz.</em> Lands, Housing, Shipping, Commodities,
Furniture, Plate, and Money, that scarce one part of an hundred
is Coin; and that perhaps there is scarce six millions of Pounds
now in <em>England</em>, that is but twenty shillings a head for every
head in the Nation. We may easily judge, how difficult it is
for men of competent estates, to pay a Summe of money on a
sudden; which if they cannot compass, Severities, and Charges
ensue; and that with reason, though unluckie enough,
it being more tolerable to undoe one particular Member, then
to endanger the whole, notwithstanding indeed it be more
tolerable for one particular Member to be undone with the
whole, then alone.</p>

<p>15. 10. It seems somewhat hard, that all Taxes should be
paid in money, <ins class="corrx" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Erratum applied">viz.</ins>, (when the King hath occasion to
Victual his Ships at <em>Portsmouth</em>) that Fat Oxen, and Corn
should not be received in kind, but that Farmers must first
carry their Corn perhaps ten Miles to sell, and turn into
money; which being paid to the King, is again reconverted
into Corn, fetcht many miles further.</p>

<p>16. Moreover, the Farmer for haste is forced to under-sell
his Corn, and the King for haste likewise, is forced to over-buy
his provisions. Whereas the paying in kinde, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Pro Hic &amp;
Nunc</i>, would lessen a considerable grievance to the poor
people.</p>

<p>17. The next confederation shall be of the consequences,
and effects of too great a Tax, not in respect of particular
men, of which we have spoken before, but to the whole
people in general: To which I say, that there is a certain
measure, and proportion of money requisite to drive the trade
of a Nation, more or less then which would prejudice the
same. Just as there is a certain proportion of Farthings necessary
in a small retail Trade, to change silver money, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
to even such reckonings as cannot be adjusted with the smallest
silver pieces. For money, (made of Gold and silver) is to
the <ins class="corrx" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Erratum applied">τἁ χρἠϛα</ins> (that is to the matter of our Food and Covering)
but as Farthings, and other local extrinsick money, is to
the Gold and Silver species.</p>

<p>18. Now as the proportion of the number of Farthings
requisite in comerse is to be taken from the number of people,
the frequency of their exchanges; as also, and principally from
the value of the smallest silver pieces of money; so in like maner,
the proportion of money requisite to our Trade, is to be likewise
taken from the frequency of commutations, and from the
bigness of the payments, that are by Law or Custome usually
made otherwise. From whence it follows, that where there
are Registers of Lands, whereby the just value of each mans
interest in them, may be well known; and where there are
Depositories of the τἁ χρἠϛα, as of Metals, Cloth, Linnen,
Leather, and other Usefuls; and where there are Banks of
money also, there less money is necessary to drive the Trade.
For if all the greatest payments be made in Lands, and the
other perhaps down to ten pound, or twenty pound be made
by credit in Lombars or Money-Banks: It follows, that there
needs onely money to pay sums less then those aforementioned;
just as fewer Farthings are requisite for change, where
there be plenty of silver two Pences, then where the least
silver piece is six Pence.</p>

<p>19. To apply all this, I say, that if there be too much money
in a Nation, it were good for the Commonalty, as well
as the King, and no harm even to particular men, if the King
had in his Coffers, all that is <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'superflous, no more'">superfluous, no more</ins> then if men
were permitted to pay their Taxes in any thing they could best
spare.</p>

<p>20. On the other side, if the largeness of a publick Exhibition
should leave less money then is necessary to drive the Nations
Trade, then the mischief thereof would be the doing of
less work, which is the same as lessening the people, or their
Art and Industry; for a hundred pound passing a hundred
hands for Wages, causes a 10000<em>l.</em> worth of Commodities to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
be produced, which hands would have been idle and useless,
had there not been this continual motive to their employment.</p>

<p>21. Taxes if they be presently expended upon our own Domestick
Commodities, seem to me, to do little harm to the
whole Body of the people, onely they work a change in the
Riches and Fortunes of particular men; and particularly by
transferring the same from the Landed and Lazy, to the
Crafty and Industrious. As for example, if a Gentleman have
let his Lands to Farm for a hundred pound <em>per annum</em>, for
several years or lives, and he be taxed twenty pound <em>per annum</em>,
to maintain a Navy; then the effect hereof will be, that this
Gentleman’s twenty pound <em>per annum</em>, will be distributed amongst
Seamen, Ship-Carpenters, and other Trades relating
to Naval matters; but if the Gentleman had his Land in his
own hands, then being taxed a Fifth part, he would raise his
Rents near the same proportion upon his under Tenants, or
would sell his Cattle, Corn, and Wooll a Fifth part dearer;
the like also would all other subdependents on him do; and
thereby recover in some measure, what he paid. Lastly, but
if all the money levied were thrown into the Sea, then the
ultimate effect would onely be, that every man must work a
fifth part the harder, or retrench a fifth part of his consumptions,
<em>viz.</em> the former, if forreign Trade be improveable, and
the latter, if it be not.</p>

<p>22. This, I conceive, were the worst of Taxes in a well
policyed State; but in other States, where is not a certain
prevention of Beggary and Theevery, that is a sure livelihood
for men wanting imployment; there, I confess, an excessive
Taxe, causes excessive and insuperable want, even of natural
necessities, and that on a sudden, so as ignorant particular
persons, cannot finde out what way to subsist by; and this, by
the law of Nature, must cause sudden effects to relieve it self,
that is, Rapines, Frauds; and this again must bring Death,
Mutilations, and <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'Impisonments, according to'">Imprisonments, according to</ins> the present
Laws which are Mischiefs, and Punishments, as well unto the
State, as to the particular sufferers of them.</p>

<span class="chap-sum"><em>Of the several wayes of Taxe, and first, of setting
a part, a proportion of the whole Territory for Publick uses, in the nature of
Crown Lands; and secondly, by way of Assessement, or Land-taxe.</em></span></h2>


<p class="drop-capy">But supposing, that the several causes of Publick Charge
are lessened as much as may be, and that the people be
well satisfied, and contented to pay their just shares of what
is needfull for their Government and Protection, as also for
the Honour of their Prince and Countrey: It follows now
to propose the several wayes, and expedients, how the same
may be most easily, speedily, and insensibly collected. The
which I shall do, by exposing the conveniencies and inconveniences
of some of the principal wayes of Levyings, used of
later years within the several States of <em>Europe</em>: unto which
others of smaller and more rare use may be referred.</p>

<p>2. Imagine then, a number of people, planted in a Territory,
who had upon Computation concluded, that two Millions
of pounds <em>per annum</em>, is necessary to the publick charges.
Or rather, who going more wisely to work, had computed a
twenty fifth part of the proceed of all their Lands and Labours,
were to be the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la"><ins class="corrx" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Erratum applied">Excisum</ins></i>, or the part to be cut out, and
laid aside for publick uses. Which proportions perhaps are fit
enough to the affairs of <em>England</em>, but of that hereafter.</p>

<p>3. Now the question is, how the one or the other shall be
raised. The first way we propose, is, to Excize the very
Land it self in kinde; that is, to cut out of the whole twenty
five Millions, which are said to be in <em>England</em> and <em>Wales</em>, as
much Land <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">in specie</i>, as whereof the Rack-rent would be two
Millions, <em>viz.</em> about four Millions of Acres, which is about a
sixth part of the whole; making the said four Millions to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
Crown Lands, and as the four Counties intended to be reserved
in <em>Ireland</em> upon the forfeitures were. Or else to excize
a sixth part of the rent of the whole, which is about the proportion,
that the Adventurers and Souldiers in <em>Ireland</em> retribute
to the King, as Quit Rents. Of which two wayes, the
latter is manifestly the better, the King having more security,
and more <ins class="corrx" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Erratum applied">obligees</ins>, provided the trouble and charge of
this universal Collection, exceed not that of the other advantage
considerably.</p>

<p>4. This way in a new State would be good, being agreed
upon, as it was in <em>Ireland</em>, before men had even the possession
of any Land at all; wherefore whosoever buyes Land in <em>Ireland</em>
hereafter, is no more concerned with the Quit Rents
wherewith they are charged, then if the Acres were so much
the fewer; or then men are, who buy Land, out of which they
know Tythes are to be paid. And truly that Countrey is
happy, in which by Original Accord, such a Rent is reserved,
as whereby the Publick charge may be born, without contingent,
sudden, superadditions, in which lies the very <em>Ratio</em> of
the burthen of all Contributions and Exactions. For in such
cases, as was said before, it is not onely the Landlord payes,
but every man who eats but an Egg, or an Onion of the
growth of his Lands; or who useth the help of any Artisan,
which feedeth on the same.</p>

<p>5. But if the same were propounded in <em>England</em>, <em>viz.</em> if an
aliquot part of every Landlords Rent were excinded or retrenched,
then those whose Rents were settled, and determined
for long times to come, would chiefly bear the burthen of
such an Imposition, and others have a benefit thereby. For
suppose <em><span class="fs80">A.</span></em> and <em><span class="fs80">B.</span></em> have each of them a parcel of Land, of
equal goodness and value; suppose also that <em><span class="fs80">A.</span></em> hath let his
parcel for twenty one years at twenty pound <em>per annum</em>, but
that <em><span class="fs80">B.</span></em> is free; now there comes out a Taxe of a fifth part;
hereupon <em><span class="fs80">B.</span></em> will not let under 25<em>l.</em> that his remainder
may be twenty, whereas <em><span class="fs80">A.</span></em> must be contented with sixteen
neat; nevertheless the Tenants of <em><span class="fs80">A.</span></em> will sell the proceed of
their bargain at the same rate, that the Tenants of <em><span class="fs80">B.</span></em> shall do.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
The effect of all this is; First, that the Kings fifth part
of <em><span class="fs80">B.</span></em> his Farm, shall be greater then before. Secondly, that
the Farmer to <em><span class="fs80">B.</span></em> shall gain more then before the Taxe.
Thirdly, that the Tenant or Farmer of <em><span class="fs80">A.</span></em> shall gain as much
as the King and Tenant to <em><span class="fs80">B.</span></em> both. Fourthly, the Tax doth
ultimately light upon the Landlord <em><span class="fs80">A.</span></em> and the Consumptioners.
From whence it follows, that a Land-taxe resolves into
an irregular Excize upon consumptions, that those bear it
most, who least complain. And lastly, that some Landlords
may gain, and onely such whose Rents are predetermined
shall loose; and that doubly, <em>viz.</em> one way by the raising of
their revenues, and the other by <ins class="corrx" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Erratum applied">enhansing</ins> the prices of
provisions upon them.</p>

<p>6. Another way is an <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Excisum</i> out of the Rent of Houseing,
which is much more uncertain then that of Land. For
an House is of a double nature, <em>viz.</em> one, wherein it is a way
and means of expence; the other, as ’tis an Instrument and
Tool of gain: for a Shop in <em>London</em> of less capacity and less
charge in building then a fair Dining-Room in the same
House, unto which both do belong, shall nevertheless be of
the greater value; so also shall a Dungeon, Sellar, then a
pleasant Chamber; because the one is expence, the other
profit. Now the <ins class="corrx" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Erratum applied">way of a Land-taxe</ins> rates housing, as of the latter
nature, but the Excize, as of the former.</p>

<p>7. We <ins class="corrx" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Erratum applied">might adde</ins> hereunto, that housing is
sometimes disproportionally taxed to discourage Building,
especially upon new Foundations, thereby to prevent the
growth of a City; suppose <em>London</em>, such excessive and overgrown
Cities being dangerous to Monarchy, though the
more secure when the Supremacy is in Citizens of such places
themselves, as in <em>Venice</em>.</p>

<p>8. But we say, that such checking of new Buildings signifies
nothing to this purpose; for as much as Buildings do not
encrease, until the People already have increased: but the remedy
of the abovementioned dangers is to be sought in the
causes of the encrease of People, the which if they can be
nipt, the other work will necessarily be done.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span></p>

<p>But what then is the true effect of forbidding to build upon
new foundations? I answer to keep and fasten the City to
its old seat and ground-plot, the which encouragement for
new Buildings will remove, as it comes to pass almost in all
great Cities, though insensibly, and not under many years
progression.</p>

<p>9. The reason whereof is, because men are unwilling to
build new houses at the charge of pulling down their old,
where both the old house it self, and the ground it stands
upon do make a much dearer ground-plot for a new house, and
yet far less free and convenient; wherefore men build upon
new free foundations, and cobble up old houses, until they become
fundamentally irreparable, at which time they become
either the dwelling of the Rascality, or in process of time return
to waste and Gardens again, examples whereof are many
even about <em>London</em>.</p>

<p>Now if great Cities are naturally apt to remove their Seats,
I ask which way? I say, in the case of <em>London</em>, it must be
Westward, because the Windes blowing near
<span class="blkb">
  <span class="blka">3.</span>
  <span class="blka over">4.</span>
</span> of the year
from the West, the dwellings of the West end are so much
the more free from the fumes, steams, and stinks of the whole
Easterly Pyle; which where Seacoal is burnt is a great matter.
Now if it follow from hence, that the Pallaces of the greatest
men will remove Westward, it will also naturally follow, that
the dwellings of others who depend upon them will creep after
them. This we see in <em>London</em>, where the Noblemens ancient
houses are now become Halls for Companies, or turned
Into Tenements, and All the Pallaces are Gotten Westward;
Insomuch, As I Do Not Doubt but That Five Hundred Years Hence,
The Kings Pallace will be near <em>Chelsey</em>, and the Old Building Of
<em>Whitehall</em> converted to uses more answerable to their quality.
For to build a new Royal Pallace upon the same ground will
be too great a confinement, in respect of Gardens and other
magnificencies, and withall a disaccommodation in the time
of the work; but it rather seems to me, that the next
Palace will be built from the whole present contignation of
houses at such a distance as the old Pallace of <em>Westminster</em><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
was from the City of <em>London</em>, when the Archers began to bend
their bowes just without <em>Ludgate</em>, and when all the space between
the <em>Thames</em>, <em>Fleet-street</em>, and <em>Holborn</em> was as <em>Finsbury-Fields</em>
are now.</p>

<p>10. This digression I confess to be both impertinent to the
business of Taxes, and in it self almost needless; for why
should we trouble our selves what shall be five hundred years
hence, not knowing what a day may bring forth; and since
’tis not unlikely, but that before that time we may be all transplanted
from hence into <em>America</em>, these Countreys being overrun
with Turks, and made waste, as the Seats of the famous
Eastern Empires at this day are.</p>

<p>11. Onely I think ’tis certain, that while ever there are
people in <em>England</em>, the greatest cohabitation of them will be
about the place which is now <em>London</em>, the <em>Thames</em> being the
most commodious River of this Island, and the seat of <em>London</em>
the most commodious part of the <em>Thames</em>; so much doth
the means of facilitating Carriage greaten a City, which may
put us in minde of employing our idle hands about mending
the High-wayes, making Bridges, Cawseys, and Rivers navigable:
Which considerations brings me back round into my
way of Taxes, from whence I digrest.</p>

<p>12. But before we talk too much of <ins class="corrx" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Erratum applied">Rents in order to Taxes, we</ins> should endeavour
to explain the mysterious nature of them, with reference
as well to Money, the rent of which we call usury; as
to that of Lands and Houses, aforementioned.</p>

<p>13. Suppose a man could with his own hands plant a certain
scope of Land with Corn, that is, could Digg, or Plough,
Harrow, Weed, Reap, Carry home, Thresh, and Winnow
so much as the Husbandry of this Land requires; and had
withal Seed wherewith to sowe the same. I say, that when
this man hath subducted his seed out of the proceed of his
Harvest, and also, what himself hath both eaten and given to
others in exchange for Clothes, and other Natural necessaries;
that the remainder of Corn, is the natural and true Rent of the
Land for that year; and the <em>medium</em> of seven years, or rather
of so many years as makes up the Cycle, within which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
Dearths and Plenties make their revolution, doth give the
ordinary Rent of the Land in Corn.</p>

<p>14. But a further, though collaterall question may be, how
much English money this Corn or Rent is worth? I answer,
so much as the money, which another single man can save,
within the same time, over and above his expence, if he imployed
himself wholly to produce and make it; <em>viz.</em> Let another
man go travel into a Countrey where is Silver, there Dig
it, Refine it, bring it to the same place where the other man
planted his Corn; Coyne it, &amp;c. the same person, all the
while of his working for Silver, gathering also food for his necessary
livelihood, and procuring himself covering, &amp;c. I say,
the Silver of the one, must be esteemed of equal value with the
Corn of the other; the one being perhaps twenty Ounces,
and the other twenty Bushels. From whence it follows, that
the price of a Bushel of this Corn to be an Ounce of Silver.</p>

<p>15. And forasmuch as possibly there may be more Art and
Hazzard in working about the Silver, then about the Corn,
yet all comes to the same pass; for let a hundred men work
ten years upon Corn, and the same number of men, the same
time, upon Silver; I say, that the neat proceed of the Silver
is the price of the whole neat proceed of the Corn, and like
parts of the one, the price of like parts of the other. Although
not so many of those who wrought in Silver, learned
the Art of refining and coining, or out-lived the dangers
and diseases of working in the Mines. And this also is the
way of pitching the true proportion, between the values of
Gold and Silver, which many times is set but by popular
errour, sometimes more, sometimes less, diffused in the world;
which errour (by the way) is the cause of our having been
pestred with too much Gold heretofore, and wanting it now.</p>

<p>16. This, I say, to be the foundation of equallizing and
ballancing of values; yet in the superstructures and practices
hereupon, I confess there is much variety, and intricacy; of
which hereafter.</p>

<p>17. The world measures things by Gold and Silver, but
principally the latter; for there may not be two measures,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
and consequently the better of many must be the onely of all;
that is, by fine silver of a certain weight; but now if it be
hard to measure the weight and fineness of silver, as by the
different reports of the ablest Saymasters I have known it to
be; and if silver granted to be of the same fineness and
weight, rise and fall in its price, and be more worth at one
place then another, not onely for being farther from the
Mines, but for other accidents, and may be more worth at
present, then a moneth or other small time hence; and if it
differ in its proportion unto the several things valued by it, in
several ages upon the increase and diminution thereof, we
shall endeavour to examine some other natural Standards and
Measures, without derogating from the excellent use of these.</p>

<p>18. Our Silver and Gold we call by severall names, as in
<em>England</em> by pounds, shillings, and pence, all which may be
called and understood by either of the three. But that which
I would say upon this matter is, that all things ought to be valued
by two natural Denominations, which is Land and Labour;
that is, we ought to say, a Ship or garment is worth
such a measure of Land, with such another measure of Labour;
forasmuch as both Ships and Garments were the creatures of
Lands and mens Labours thereupon: This being true, we
should be glad to finde out a natural Par between Land and
Labour, so as we might express the value by either of them
alone as well or better then by both, and reduce one into the
other as easily and certainly as we reduce pence into pounds.
Wherefore we would be glad to finde the natural values of the
Fee simple of Land, though but no better then we have done
that of the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">usus fructus</i> abovementioned, which we attempt as
followeth.</p>

<p>19. Having found the Rent or value of the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">usus fructus per
annum</i>, the question is, how many years purchase (as we usually
say) is the Fee simple naturally worth? If we say an infinite
number, then an Acre of Land would be equal in value
to a thousand Acres of the same Land; which is absurd, an <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'infinity of unites'">infinity
of unities</ins> being equal to an infinity of thousands. Wherefore
we must pitch upon some limited number, and that I apprehend<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
to be the number of years, which I conceive one man
of fifty years old, another of twenty eight, and another of
seven years old, all being alive together may be thought to
live; that is to say, of a Grandfather, Father, and Childe;
few men having reason to take care of more remote Posterity:
for if a man be a great Grandfather, he himself is so
much the nearer his end, so as there are but three in a continual
line of descent usually co-existing together; and as some
are Grandfathers at forty years, yet as many are not till above
sixty, and <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">sic de cæteris</i>.</p>

<p>20. Wherefore I pitch the number of years purchase, that
any Land is naturally worth, to be the ordinary extent of
three such persons their lives. Now in <em>England</em> we esteem
three lives equal to one and twenty years, and consequently
the value of Land, to be about the same number of years purchase.
Possibly if they thought themselves mistaken in the
one, (as the observator on the Bills of Mortality thinks they
are) they would alter in the other, unless the confederation of
the force of popular errour and dependance of things already
concatenated, did hinder them.</p>

<p>21. This I esteem to be the number of years purchase
where Titles are good, and where there is a moral certainty
of enjoying the purchase. But in other Countreys Lands are
worth nearer thirty years purchase, by reason of the better
Titles, more people, and perhaps truer opinion of the value
and duration of three lives.</p>

<p>22. And in some places, Lands are worth yet more years
purchase by reason of some special honour, pleasures, priviledge
or jurisdiction annexed unto them.</p>

<p>23. On the other hand, Lands are worth fewer years purchase
(as in <em>Ireland</em>) for the following reasons, which I have
here set down, as unto the like whereof the cause of the like
cheapness in any other place may be imputed.</p>

<p>First, In <em>Ireland</em> by reason of the frequent Rebellions, (in
which if you are conquered, all is lost; or if you conquer, yet
you are subject to swarms of thieves and robbers) and the envy
which precedent missions of English have against the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
subsequent, perpetuity it self is but forty years long, as within
which time some ugly disturbance hath hitherto happened
almost ever since the first coming of the English thither.</p>

<p>24. 2. The Claims upon Claims which each hath to the
others Estates, and the facility of making good any pretence
whatsoever by the favour of some one or other of the many
Governours and Ministers which within forty years shall be
in power there; as also by the frequency of false testimonies,
and abuse of solemn Oaths.</p>

<p>25. 3. The paucity of Inhabitants, there being not above the
<span class="blkb">
  <span class="blka">1.</span>
  <span class="blka over">5.</span>
</span> <sup>th.</sup> part so many as the Territory would maintain, and of
those but a small part do work at all, and yet a smaller work
so much as in other Countreys.</p>

<p>26. 4. That a great part of the Estates both real and personal
in <em>Ireland</em> are owned by Absentees, and such as draw
over the profits raised out of <em>Ireland</em> refunding nothing; so
as <em>Ireland</em> exporting more then it imports doth yet grow
poorer to a paradox.</p>

<p>27. 5. The difficulty of executing justice, so many of those
in power being themselves protected by Offices, and protecting
others. Moreover, the number of criminous and indebted
persons being great, they favour their like in Juries, Offices,
and wheresoever they can: Besides the Countrey is <ins class="corrx" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Erratum applied">seldom rich enough</ins>
to give due encouragement to profound Judges
and Lawyers, which makes judgements very casual; ignorant
men being more apt to be bold and arbitrary, then such as understand
the dangers of it. But all <ins class="corrx" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Erratum applied">this a</ins> little care in
due season might remedy, so as to bring <em>Ireland</em> in a few years
to the same level of values with other places; but of this also
elsewhere more at large, for in the next place we shall come
to Usury.</p>

<br />
<span class="chap-sum"><em>Of Usury.</em></span></h2>


<p class="drop-capy">What reason there is for taking or giving Interest or
Usury for any thing which we may certainly have
again whensoever we call for it, I see not; nor why Usury
should be scrupled, where money or other necessaries valued
by it, is lent to be paid at such a time and place as the Borrower
chuseth, so as the Lender cannot have his money paid
him back where and when himself pleaseth, I also see not.
Wherefore when a man giveth out his money upon condition
that he may not demand it back until a certain time to come,
whatsoever his own necessities shall be in the mean time, he
certainly may take a compensation for this inconvenience
which he admits against himself: And this allowance is that
we commonly call Usury.</p>

<p>2. And when one man furnisheth another with money at
some distant place, and engages under great Penalties to pay
him there, and at a certain day besides; the consideration for
this, is that we call Exchange or local Usury.</p>

<p>As for example, if a man wanting money at <em>Carlisle</em> in the
heat of the late Civil Wars, when the way was full of Souldiers
and Robbers, and the passage by Sea very long, troublesome,
and dangerous, and seldom passed; why might not another
take much more then an 100<em>l.</em> at <em>London</em> for warranting
the like summe to be paid at <em>Carlisle</em> on a certain day?</p>

<p>3. Now the Questions arising hence are; what are the
natural Standards of Usury and Exchange? As for Usury, the
least that can be, is the Rent of so much Land as the money
lent will buy, where the security is undoubted; but where the
security is casual, then a kinde of ensurance must be enterwoven
with the simple natural Interest, which may advance the
Usury very conscionably unto any height below the Principal
it self. Now if things are so in <em>England</em>, that really there is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
no such security as abovementioned, but that all are more or
less hazardous, troublesome, or chargeable to make, I see no
reason for endeavoring to limit Usury upon time, any more
then that upon place, which the practice of the world doth
not, unless it be that those who make such Laws were rather
Borrowers then Lenders: But of the vanity and fruitlessness
of making Civil Positive Laws against the Laws of Nature,
I have spoken elsewhere, and instanced in several particulars.</p>

<p>4. As for the natural measures of Exchange, I say, that in
times of Peace, the greatest Exchange can be but the labour
of carrying the money <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">in specie</i>, but where are
<ins class="corrx" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Erratum applied">hazards and</ins> emergent
uses for money more in one place then another, &amp;c. or
opinions of these true or false, the Exchange will be governed
by them.</p>

<p>5. Parallel unto this, is something which we <ins class="corrx" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Erratum applied">omitted</ins> concerning
the price of Land; for as great need of money heightens
Exchange, so doth great need of Corn raise the price of
that likewise, and consequently of the Rent of the Land that
bears Corn, and lastly of the Land it self; as for example, if
the Corn which feedeth <em>London</em>, or an Army, be brought forty
miles thither, then the Corn growing within a mile of <em>London</em>,
or the quarters of such Army, shall have added unto its
natural price, so much as the charge of bringing it thirty nine
miles doth amount unto: And unto perishable Commodities
as fresh fish, fruits, &amp;c. the ensurance upon the hazard of corrupting,
&amp;c. shall be added also; and finally unto him that
eats these things there (suppose in Taverns) shall be added
the charge of all the circumstancial <ins class="corrx" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Erratum applied">apparatus</ins> of House-rent,
Furniture, Attendance, and the Cooks skill as well as
his labour to accompany the same.</p>

<p>6. Hence it comes to pass, that Lands intrinsically alike
near populous places, such as where the perimeter of the Area
that feeds them is great, will not onely yield more Rent for
these Reasons, but also more years purchase then in remote
places, by reason of the pleasure and honour extraordinary of
having Lands there; for</p>

<p class="pad4">
&mdash;&mdash;<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Omne tulit punctum qui miscuit utile dulci.</i></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span></p>

<p>7. Having finished our digression upon the measures of the
Rents and Values of Lands and Moneys, we now return to
our second way of leavying Publick Charges, which was the
taking of a proportion of the Rent, (commonly called Assessment)
it follows next to speak of the way of computing
the said Rents, otherwise then according to the bargains
which a few men make one with another, through ignorance,
haste, false suggestion, or else in their passion or drink: Although
I acknowledge, that the medium or common result of
all the bargains made within three years (or other such Cycle
of time, as within which all contingencies of Land revolve)
may be very sufficient to this purpose, being but the summe
synthetically computed by casual opinions, as I would endeavour
to cast up analytically by a distinct particularizing of the
Causes.</p>

<p>8. 1. Therefore I propound a Survey of the Figures,
Quantities, and Scituations of all the Lands both according
to the civil bounds of Parishes, Farms, &amp;c. and the natural
distinctions thereof by the Sea, Rivers, ridges of Rocks, or
Mountains, &amp;c.</p>

<p>9. 2. I propound that the quality of each denomination
were described by the Commodities it had usually born, in
some Land, some sort of Timber, Grain, pulse or root growing
more happily then in others: Also by the encrease of
things sown or planted, which it hath yielded <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">communibus annis</i>;
and withall, the comparative goodness of the said Commodities
not unto the common Standard money, but to one
another. As for example; if there be ten acres of Land, I
would have it judged whether they be better for Hay or Corn;
if for Hay, whether the said ten Acres will bear more or less
of Hay then ten other Acres; and whether an hundred
weight of the said Hay will feed or fatten more or less, then
the same weight of other Hay, and not as yet comparing it
to money, in which the value of the said Hay will be more or
less, according to the plenty of money, which hath changed
strangely since the discovery of the <em>West Indies</em>, and according
to the multitudes of people living near this Land, together<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
with the luxurious or frugal living of them; and besides all,
according to the Civil, Natural, and Religious Opinions of
the said people: As for example, Eggs in the fore-part of
Lent (because their goodness and delicacy decayes before Lent
be done) being worth little in some Popish Countreys; nor
Swines flesh among the Jews, nor Hedgehogs, Frogs, Snails,
Mushrooms, &amp;c. to those that fear to eat them, as poisonous
or unwholesome; nor Currans and Spanish Wines, if they
were all to be destroyed as the great thieves of this Nation,
by an Edict of the State.</p>

<p>10. This <ins class="corrx" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Erratum applied">former</ins> I call a Survey or Inquisition into the intrinsick
Values of Land, <ins class="corrx" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Erratum applied">this latter</ins> of extrinsick or accidentall follows.
We said, that the change of the store of money would
change the rates of commodities according to our reckoning
in names and words, (pounds, shillings, and pence being nothing
else) as for example:</p>

<p>If a man can bring to <em>London</em> an ounce of Silver out of
the Earth in <em>Peru</em>, in the same time that he can produce a bushel
of Corn, then one is the natural price of the other; now
if by reason of new and more easie Mines a man can get two
ounces of Silver as easily as formerly he did one, then Corn
will be as cheap at ten shillings the bushel, as it was before at
five shillings <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">cæteris paribus</i>.</p>

<p>11. It behoves us therefore to have a way, whereby to tell
the money of our Countrey (which I think I have, and that
in a short time, and without cost, and (which is more) without
looking into particular mens pockets; of which hereafter.)
Now if we know what Gold and Silver we had in <em>England</em>
two hundred years ago, and could tell it again now; and
though we also knew the difference of our denominations then,
when thirty seven shillings were made out the same quantity
of Silver as sixty two are now; also that of the alloy, labour
in Coinage, remedies for weight and fineness, and duties to
the King; nay, if we also knew the Labourers wages then
and now, yet all this would not shew the difference of the
Riches of our Nation even in money alone.</p>

<p>12. Wherefore we must adde to the premises, the knowledge<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
of the difference of the numbers of the people, and
conclude, that if all the money in the Nation were equally
divided amongst all the people both then and now, that that
time wherein each Devisee had wherewith to hire most labourers,
was the richer. So that we want the knowledge of the
People and Bullion which is now in this Land, and which was
heretofore; all which I think may be found out even for the
time past, but more probably for the time present and to come.</p>

<p>13. But to proceed; suppose we had them, then we would
pitch the accidental values upon our Lands about <em>London</em>; as
thus, <em>viz.</em> We would first at hazzard compute the materials
for food and covering, which the Shires of <em>Essex</em>, <em>Kent</em>, <em>Surrey</em>,
<em>Middlesex</em> and <em>Hertford</em>, next circumjacent to <em>London</em>, did <em>communibus
annis</em> produce; and would withal compute the Consumptioners
of them living in the said five Shires and <em>London</em>. The
which if I found to be more then were the Consumptioners
living upon the like scope of other Land, or rather upon as
much other Land as bore the like quantity of Provisions.
Then I say, that Provisions must be dearer in the said five
Shires then in the other; and within the said Shires cheaper
or dearer as the way to <em>London</em> was more or less long, or rather
more or less chargeable.</p>

<p>14. For if the said five Shires did already produce as much
Commodity, as by all endeavour was possible; then what is
wanting must be brought from a far, and that which is near,
advanced in price accordingly; or <ins class="corrx" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Erratum applied">if the</ins> said Shires by
greater labour then now is used, (as by digging instead
of Ploughing, setting instead of sowing, picking of choice
seed instead of taking it promiscuously, steeping it instead of
using it wholly unprepared, and manuring the ground with
salt instead of rotten straw, <ins class="corrx" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Erratum applied">&amp;c. could be fertilized) then</ins> will the Rent be as
much more advanced, as the excess of encrease exceeds that
of the labour.</p>

<p>15. Now the price of labour must be certain, (as we see
it made by the Statutes which limit the day wages of several
workmen); the non-observance of which Laws, and the not
adapting them to the change of times, is by the way very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
dangerous, and confusive to all endeavours of bettering the
Trade of the Nation.</p>

<p>16. Moreover, the touchstone to try whether it be better
to use those improvements or not, is to examine whether the
labour of fetching these things even from the places where
they grow wilde, or with less Culture, be not less then that of
the said improvements.</p>

<p>17. Against all this will be objected, that these computations
are very hard if not impossible to make; to which I answer
onely this, that they are so, especially if none will trouble
their hands or heads to make them, or give authority for so
doing: But withall, I say, that until this be done, Trade will
be too conjectural a work for any man to employ his thoughts
about; for it will be the same wisdom in order to win with
fair Dice, to spend much time in considering how to hold
them, how much to shake them, and how hard to throw them,
and on what angles they should hit the side of the Tables,
as to consider how to advance the Trade of this Nation;
where at present particular men get from their neighbours (not
from the earth and sea) rather by hit then wit, and by the false
opinions of others, rather then their own judgements; Credit
every where, but chiefly in <em>London</em>, being become a meer
conceit, that a man is responsible or not, without any certain
knowledge of his Wealth or true Estate. Whereas I think
the nature of credit should be limited onely to an opinion of
a mans faculties to get by his art and industry. The way of
knowing his Estate being to be made certain, and the way of
making him pay what he owes to the utmost of his ability,
being to be expected from the good execution of our Laws.</p>

<p>18. I should here enlarge upon a Paradox, to prove that if
every mans Estate could be alwayes read in his forehead, our
Trade would much be advanced thereby, although the poorer
ambitious man be commonly the more industrious. But of this
elsewhere.</p>

<p>19. The next objection against this so exact computation of
the Rents and <ins class="corrx" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Erratum applied">worth</ins> of Lands, &amp;c. is, that the Sovereign
would know too exactly every mans Estate; to which I answer,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
that if the Charge of the Nation be brought as low as
it may be, (which depends much upon the people in Parliament
to do) and if the people be willing and ready to pay,
and if care be taken, that although they have not ready money,
the credit of their Lands and Goods shall be as good; and
lastly, that it would be a great discommodity to the Prince to
take more then he needs, as was proved before; where is the
evil of this so exact knowledge? And as for the proportion
of every Contributor, why should any man hope or accept to
ease himself by his craft and interest in a confusion? or why
should he not fear, though he may be advantaged this time, to
suffer in the next.</p>

<span class="chap-sum"><em>Of Customs and Free Ports.</em></span></h2>


<p class="drop-capy">Custom is a Contribution or <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Excisum</span> out of Goods sent
out or imported into the Princes Dominions: In these
Countreys of a twentieth part not according to the Prices
currant among Merchants of each respective Commodity,
but according to other standing Rates set by the State,
though advised for the most part by concerned Persons.</p>

<p>2. I cannot well imagine what should be the natural Reasons,
why a Prince should be paid this duty inward and outward
both; there seems indeed to be some, why he should
be paid for indulging the Exportation of some such things as
other Countreys do really want.</p>

<p>3. Wherefore I think, that Customs at the first were a <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">præmium</i>
allowed the Prince for protecting the Carriage of Goods
both inward and outward from the Pyrats; and this I should
verily believe, if the Prince were bound to make good losses
of that kinde. And I thought that the proportion of five
pound <em>per cent.</em> was pitched upon computation, that the Merchants<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
before the said undertaking and composition, had usually
lost more by Pyracy: And finally, that the Customs had been an
ensurance upon losses by enemies, as the ensurance now usual, is
of the casualties of sea, winde, weather and Vessel, or altogether;
or like the ensurance in some Countreys of Houses
from Fires for a certain small part of their yearly Rent. But
be it what it will, it is anciently established by Law, and ought
to be paid until it shall be abolished. Onely I take leave as an
idle Philosopher to discourse upon the Nature and Measures
of it.</p>

<p>4. The Measures of Customs outwards may be such, as after
reasonable profit to the Exporter will leave such of our
own Commodities as are necessary to Forreigners somewhat
cheaper unto them then they can be had from elsewhere.</p>

<p>As for example, Tin is a Native Commodity, which governs
the <ins class="corrx" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Erratum applied">Market abroad</ins>, that is, there is none so good and so easie
to be had and exported.</p>

<p>Now suppose Tin might be made in <em>Cornwall</em> for four pence
the pound, and that the same would yield twelve pence at the
nearest part in <em>France</em>, I say, that this extraordinary profit
ought to be esteemed as a Mine Royal, or <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Tresor Trové</i>, and
the Sovereign ought to have his share in it: Which he will
have, by imposing so great a duty upon Tin Exported, as on
one side may leave a subsistence to the Workmen, (and no
more) with a competent profit to the owners of the ground;
and on the other side, may leave the price abroad less then that
for which Tin may be had from any other place.</p>

<p>5. The same Imposition might also be made on the Tin
spent at home, unless it be as impossible so to do, as for the
King of <em>France</em> to impose the Gabel upon Salt in the very
places where it is made.</p>

<p>6. But it is observed, that such high duties make men endeavour
not to enter any such Goods at all, or pay for them,
provided the charge of smuckling and bribing, with the hazzard
of being seized do not <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">communibus vicibus</i> exceed the
Duty.</p>

<p>7. Wherefore the Measures of this Nature are, that it be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
more easie, safe, and profitable for men to keep the Law, then
to break it, unless it be in such cases, where the Magistrate
can with certainty execute the Law. As for example, it would
be hard to save the Duties upon Horses shipped at a small Port,
without adjacent Creeks, and that but some certain two hours
every Tide, forasmuch as Horses cannot be disguised, put up
in bags or cask, nor shipped without noise and the help of many
hands.</p>

<p>8. The Measures of Customs upon imported Commodities
are; 1. That all things ready and ripe for Consumption
may be made somewhat dearer then the same things grown or
made at home; if the same be feasible <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">cæteris <ins class="corrx" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Erratum applied">paribus</ins></i>.</p>

<p>2. That all Superfluities tending to Luxury and sin, might
be loaded with so much Impost, as to serve instead of a sumptuary
Law to restrain the use of them. But here also care is
to be had that it be not better to smuckle then to pay.</p>

<p>9. On the contrary, all things not fully wrought and Manufactured,
as raw Hides, Wool, Beaver, Raw-silk, Cotton; as
also all Tools and Materials for Manufacture, as also Dying-stuff,
&amp;c. ought to be gently dealt with.</p>

<p>10. If to leavy the payment of these Duties could be most
exactly performed, Princes might strangely practice one upon
another; wherefore since they cannot, the people pay no
more then they cannot with greater safety upon the whole
matter save, nor observe any more of these Laws, then they
cannot elude.</p>

<p>11. The Inconveniences of the way of Customs, are, <em>viz.</em></p>

<p>1. That Duties are laid upon things not yet ripe for use,
upon Commodities in <em>fieri</em>, and but in the way of their full
improvements, which seems the same ill-husbandry, as to
make fuel of young Saplings, instead of Dotards and Pollards.</p>

<p>2. The great number of Officers requisite to Collect <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'the said Duies,'">the
said Duties,</ins> especially in a Countrey where the Harbours are
many, and the Tides convenient for shipping of Goods at
any time.</p>

<p>3. The great facility of smuckling by Briberies, Collusions,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
hiding and disguising of Commodities, &amp;c. and all this
notwithstanding Oaths and Penalties, and withall by the several
wayes of mitigating and taking off the said Penalties even
after discovery.</p>

<p>4. The Customs or Duties upon the few Commodities of
the growth of <em>England</em> exchanged with Foreigners, make
too small a part of the whole Expence of the people of this
Kingdom, which (perhaps is not less then fifty millions of
pounds <em>per annum</em>) out of which to bear the common
Charges thereof, so as some other way of Leavy must be practised
together with it; whereas by some one way, if the best,
the whole work may be absolved: wherefore ’tis an inconvenience
in the way of Customs, that it necessitates other wayes
then it self.</p>

<p>12. Now as a small attempt of a Remedy or Expedient
herein, I offer rather, that instead of the Customs upon Goods
shipped, every Ship that goes in or out, may pay a Tonnage,
the same being collectible by a very few hands, as a matter visible
to all the world; and that the said Duty be but such a
part of the Fraight, as the like whereof being excinded out
of the whole Consumption, would defray all the Publique
Charge; which part perhaps is 4. <em>per Cent.</em> or thereabouts,
<em>viz.</em> two millions <em>per annum</em> out of fifty.</p>

<p>13. The other is, that the Customs be reduced into the
nature of an Ensurance-<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">præmium</i>, and that the same be
augmented and fitted, as whereby the King may afford to ensure
the goods as well against the Sea as Enemies; by which
means the whole Nation would be concerned in all such losses,
and then the Merchant for his own sake would more willingly
enter and pay for whatsoever he would have ensured.</p>

<p>14. But it will be here objected, that although the duty of
Customs be abrogated, yet that there must be almost the same
number of Officers maintained as now to prevent the bringing
in and carrying out of prohibited Commodities. Wherefore
we shall here state the nature of such Prohibitions by two
or three grand instances.</p>

<p>15. To prohibit the Exportation of Money, in that it is a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
thing almost impracticable, it is almost nugatory and vain;
And the danger of it resolves either into a kinde of Ensurance
answerable to the danger of being seized, or unto a Surcharge
of a Composition by bribing the Searchers. As for
example, If but one in fifty Exportations are seized, or if
twenty shillings be usually taken for <ins class="corrx" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Erratum applied">conniving</ins> at fifty pounds,
then the Commodities bought with this Money must be sold
two at least <em>per cent.</em> the dearer to the Consumptioner. Now if
the Trade will not bear this Surcharge, then Money will not
be exported with discretion. Now the use of this Prohibition,
supposing it practicable, is to serve as a sumptuary Law,
and to binde the Nation in general not to spend more then
they get; for if we could export no Commodity of our own
growth or manufacture then by prohibiting the going out of
Money, it is also <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ipso facto</i> commanded that nothing forreign
should be brought in. Again supposing, that ordinarily we
export enough to furnish us with all Forreign Commodities,
but upon some extraordinary decay of our Land or hands, we
are able to export but half as much as would procure our
ordinary proportion of Forreign Goods, then the Prohibition
of Money performs indeed the part of a sumptuary Law, in
hindring us to bring in any more then half as much Forreign
Commodities as we formerly used, onely it leaves it to the discretion
of the Merchant, to chose which he will neglect or
forbear to bring in, and which not; whereas in sumptuary
Laws the State taketh this care upon themselves. As for example,
If we wanted Exportation to ballance our Importations
by forty thousand pounds, and suppose for examples
sake, that the Importation of forty thousand pounds worth
of Coffee-Berries, or the like of Spanish Wine must be retrenched;
in this case, the said Prohibition of Money will do
one, or some <ins class="corrx" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Erratum applied">of the one</ins>, and some of the
<ins class="corrx" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Erratum applied">other as</ins>
the Merchant himself pleases: But the sumptuary Law determines,
whether we shall encourage and keep fair with the
Nation that sends us Wine rather then that which sends us
<ins class="corrx" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Erratum applied">Coffee, and</ins> whether the Expence of Wine or Coffee be most prejudicial
to our people, &amp;c.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span></p>

<p>16. The benefits alledged for the free Exportation of
Money is <ins class="corrx" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Erratum applied">meerly</ins> this, <em>viz.</em> That if a Ship carrying out of
<em>England</em> forty thousand pounds worth of Cloth, might also carry
with it forty thousand pounds in Money, then could the
Merchant stand the stiffer upon his terms, and in fine would
buy cheaper, and sell dearer; but by the way, the Merchant
buyes this power with the <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'Intrest and     of the'">Interest and advantage of the</ins>
Money he carries, which if it amount to five pound <em>per Cent.</em>
then he had better sold his Goods at four pound <em>per Cent.</em> under
rate, then to have fortified himself with Money as aforesaid.
But of this more may be said, we hasten to the great
point of Wool.</p>

<p>17. The Hollanders having gotten away our Manufacture
of Cloth, by becoming able to work with more art, to labour
and fare harder, to take less fraight, Duties and Ensurance,
hath so madded us here in <em>England</em>, that we have been apt to
think of such exorbitantly fierce wayes of prohibiting Wool
and Earth to be exported, as perhaps would do us twice as
much harm as the losse of our said Trade. Wherefore to return
to our Wits and Trade again, before we can tell what to
do in this case, we must consider;</p>

<p>1. That we are often forced to buy Corn from abroad, and
as often complain that we are pestered with abundance of idle
hands at home, and withall that we cannot vend the Woollen
Manufactures even which our few working hands do produce.
In this case were it not better to lessen our sheep-trade, and
convert our hands to more Tillage? Because 1. Flesh becomming
dearer, there would be encouragement for Fish, which
will never be till then. 2. Our Money would not run so fast
away for Corn. 3. We should have no such Gluts of Wool
upon our hands. 4. Our idle hands would be employed in
Tillage and Fishing, one man by the way of grazing, tilling
as it were many thousand Acres of Land by himself and his
Dog.</p>

<p>2. Suppose we wanted no Corn, nor had any idle hands, and
yet that we abounded with more Wool then we can work up;
in this <ins class="corrx" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Erratum applied">case certainly</ins> Wool might be exported, because ’tis<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
supposed, that the hands which work are already employed upon
a better Trade.</p>

<p>3. Suppose the Hollander outdo us by more art, were it
not better to draw over a number of their choice Workmen,
or send our most ingenious men thither to learn; which if
they succeed; it is most manifest, that this were the more natural
way, then to keep that infinite clutter about <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'resisting of   ture'">resisting of
Nature</ins>, stopping up the windes and seas, &amp;c.</p>

<p>4. If we can make Victual much cheaper here then in <em>Holland</em>,
take away burdensome, frivolous, and antiquated Impositions
and Offices.</p>

<p>I conceive even this were better then to perswade Water to
<ins class="corrx" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Erratum applied">rise of</ins> it self above its natural Spring.</p>

<p>5. We must consider in general, that as wiser Physicians
tamper not excessively with their Patients, rather observing
and complying with the motions of nature, then contradicting
it with vehement Administrations of their own; so in
Politicks and Oconomicks the same must be used; for</p>

<p class="pad4">
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Naturam expellas furcâ licet usque recurrit.</i></p>

<p>18. Nevertheless, if the Hollanders advantages in making
Cloth be but small and few in comparison of ours, that is, if
they have but a little the better of us, then I conceive that
Prohibitions to export Wool may sufficiently turn the scales.
But whether this be <ins class="corrx" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Erratum applied">so or not</ins>, I leave to others, being my self neither
<ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'Merchant nor Statseman'">Merchant nor Statesman</ins>.</p>

<p>19. As for Prohibition of Importations, I say that it needs
not be, until they much exceed our Exportations. For if we
should think it hard to give good necessary Cloth for debauching
Wines, yet if we cannot dispose of our Cloth to
others, ’twere better to give it for Wine or worse, then to
cease making it; nay, better to burn a thousand mens labours
for a time, then to let those thousand men by non-employment
lose their faculty of labouring. In brief, what may be
further said hereupon, resolves into the Doctrine and <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Ingenium</i>
of making sumptuary Laws, and judicious use of them <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">pro
hic &amp; nunc</i>.</p>

<p>20. Unto this Discourse of Customs appertains that of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
Free Ports, which (in a Nation that onely trades for it self,
<em>viz.</em> vents its own superfluities, and imports onely Necessaries
for it self) are of no use, but rather harm; for suppose Wines
be brought into a Free Port, be there housed and privately
sold, but the Cask filled up with stained water, and put on
ship-board again to be staved as soon as the ship is out at sea:
In this case, the Duties of those Wines are defrauded, as it
also may be many other wayes.</p>

<p>21. Now if it be said, that although we should trade but
for our selves, yet that our Ports (being more commodious
then those of other Nations) would be the more frequented;
for being free, and consequently the more enriched, by the
expence of Sea-men and Passengers, hire of Labourers, and
Ware-houses, &amp;c. even without any Custom at all upon the
Goods. Nevertheless ’tis reason that a small duty should be
paid upon the ship as aforesaid for such use of our Ports, and
that <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">eo nomine</i>; not expecting all our Benefit from the said
hire of Cellaridge, Porters, and Carmen, which also might be
had over and above for their proper reasons.</p>

<p>22. But if we could attain to be the Merchants between
other Nations, there is then no reason for exacting Duties (as
was said before) upon things <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">in fieri</i>, and which are but in the
way of their improvement: And as for the fraud that may
be committed, as in the case of Wines abovementioned, I
affirm that our Excize upon the Consumption, would overcome
and elude them.</p>

<span class="chap-sum"><em>Of Poll-money.</em></span></h2>


<p class="drop-capy">Poll-money is a Tax upon the Persons of men, either upon
all simply and indifferently, or else according to some
known Title or mark of distinction upon each; and that either
of bare honour, or else of some Office sought or imposed,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
or of some Faculty and Calling without respect to Riches or
Poverty, Incomes or Expence, Gain or Loss accrewing by the
said Title, Office, or Faculty.</p>

<p>2. The Poll-moneys which have been leavied of late have
been wonderfully confused; as taxing some rich single persons
at the lowest rate; some Knights, though wanting necessaries,
at twenty pounds, encouraging some vain fellows to
pay as Esquires, on purpose to have themselves written Esquires
in the Receipts; making some pay ten pounds as Doctours of
Physick or Law, who get nothing by the Faculty, nor minde
the practice; making some poor Tradesmen forced to be of
the Liveries of their Companies to pay beyond their strength;
and lastly, some to pay according to their Estates, the same to
be valued by those that know them not; thereby also giving
opportunity to some Bankrupts to make the world credit
them as men of such Estates, at which the Assessors did rate
them by Collusion.</p>

<p>3. So as by this Confusion, Arbitraries, Irregularities,
and hotch-pot of Qualifications, no estimate could be
made of the fitness of this Plaister to the Sore, nor no
Checque or way to examine whether the respective Receipts
were duly accompted for, &amp;c.</p>

<p>4. Wherefore wholly rejecting the said complicated way of
Tax, I shall speak of Poll-money more distinctly, and first of
the simple Poll-money upon every head of <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'all mankiude'">all mankinde</ins> alike;
the Parish paying for those that receive alms, Parents for
their Children under age, and Masters for their Apprentices,
and others who receive no wages.</p>

<p>5. The evil of this way is, that it is very unequal; men of
unequal abilities, all paying alike, and those who have greatest
charges of Children paying most; that is, that by how much
the poorer they are, by so much the harder are they taxed.</p>

<p>6. The Conveniencies are; first, that it may be suddenly
collected, and with small charge: Secondly, that the number
of the people being alwayes known, it may be sufficiently
computed what the same will amount unto. Thirdly, It seems
to be a spur unto all men, to set their Children to some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
profitable employment upon their very first capacity, out of
the proceed whereof, to pay each childe his own Poll-money.</p>

<p>7. The next Poll-money is upon every head, but distinguished
by Titles of meer Honour, without any kinde of Office
or Faculty; as, Dukes, Marquesses, Earls, Viscounts, Barons,
Baronets, Knights, and Esquires, <em>viz.</em> the eldest Sons of
Knights <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">in perpetuum</i>, and Gentlemen if they write themselves
so. This way is much more equal then the other; forasmuch
as those who are Titled, are for the most part rich
proportionably; or if they were not, yet men so dignified
shall command a preheminence and place, even although they
do not or cannot buy it of the vulgar by their Expence: my
meaning hereby is, that a Title may possibly save a man as
much as his Poll-money, may exceed the Plebeian Level by
reason of such title.</p>

<p>8. Moreover, good and multiform Accompts being kept
of the People, this Tax may be also easily speedily and inexpensively
collected; and also being capable of being computed
aforehand, may be fitted and seized according to the needs
of the Prince.</p>

<p>9. As for Offices, they are indeed Dignities for the most
part, but paid for by the trouble of administring them; as for
example, to be an Alderman suppose of <em>London</em>, is indeed an
honour, yet many pay five hundred pounds to be excused from
receiving it.</p>

<p>Nevertheless it may not be improper to tax Offices sought;
or such as are accepted although they might be refused: And
on the other side no <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Titulado</i> should be forced to pay Poll-money
according to his Title, if he be contented to lay it down,
and never resume it more.</p>

<p>10. The Titles of Faculties and Callings ought to be no
Qualification in a Poll-money, because they do not necessarily
nor probably inferr ability to pay, but carry with them vaste
inequalities. But therefore if a man by his Licence to practise
get much, it may be presumed he will spend accordingly;
in which net the way of Excize will certainly take him, as it
will all the Officers aforementioned.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span></p>

<p>11. Harth-money seems to be a Poll-money, but is <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'not, bebeing rather'">not, being
rather</ins> a way of Accumulative Excize; of which
hereafter.</p>

<span class="chap-sum"><em>Of Lotteries.</em></span></h2>


<p class="drop-capy">Men that accept Titles may foresee, that they may be
taxed by them as aforesaid, (although it be unlikely
(one House of Parliament being all Tituladoes, and the
greatest part of the other being such also) that any such way
of Leavy should pass) and therefore they do as it were <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">à priori</i>
consent unto the Tax in their own Individuals.</p>

<p>2. Now in the way of Lottery men do also tax themselves
in the general, though out of hopes of Advantage in particular:
A Lottery therefore is properly a Tax upon unfortunate
self-conceited fools; men that have good opinion of their
own luckiness, or that have believed some Fortune-teller or
Astrologer, who had promised them great success about the
time and place of the Lottery, lying Southwest perhaps from
the place where the destiny was read.</p>

<p>3. Now because the world abounds with this kinde of fools,
it is not fit that every man that will, may cheat every man that
would be cheated; but it is rather ordained, that the Sovereign
should have the Guardianship of these fools, or that
some Favourite should beg the Sovereigns right of taking advantage
of such mens folly, even as in the case of Lunaticks
and Idiots.</p>

<p>4. Wherefore a Lottery is not tollerated without authority,
assigning the proportion in which the people shall pay for
their errours, and taking care that they be not so much and so
often couzened, as they themselves would be.</p>

<p>5. This way of Lottery is used but for small Leavies, and
rather upon privato-publick accompts, (then for maintaining<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
Armies or Equipping Fleets,) such as are Aque-Ducts,
Bridges, and perhaps Highwayes, &amp;c. Wherefore we shall
say no more of it upon this occasion.</p>

<br />
<span class="chap-sum"><em>Of Benevolence.</em></span></h2>


<p class="drop-capy">The raising of Money by Benevolence, seems to be no
force upon any man, nor to take from any man but what
himself knows he can spare, nevertheless there is more in it;
for to be but brow-beaten by a Prince or Grandee, proves often
as heavy as to be distrained upon for an Assessment or Subsidy;
and the danger of being misrepresented by linsy Pick-thanks
and Informers as disaffected to the Cause for which
the Leavy is made, is more frequent then the payment of any
summe in a due proportion with all other men (which I have
said is no impoverishment) can possibly be hurtful.</p>

<p>The benefits of this way are these, <em>viz.</em> That forasmuch as
it sometimes falls out (as in the late Differences with the
Scots, <em>annis</em> 1638. and 1639. when the Church Dignitaries
were most concerned) that the cause of the Expence concerns
some men more then others, that then an Imposition
should not pass upon all for the sakes of a part: Sometimes
it happens, that one sort of men have received greater and
fresher favours then another; as upon the late Restoration of
his Majesty <em>Anno</em> 1660. those who needed an Act of Indempnity
did: And sometimes it is visible, that some men have
had better times of gain and advantages then others, as the
Clergy most eminently have had since his Majesties said Restoration.
In all these Cases, the proposal of a Benevolence
may be offered, although in no cases it be without its inconveniencies;
the which are principally these.</p>

<p>1. The abovementioned Brow-beating and distaste given,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
if a man have not contributed as largely as envious observers
think he should have done.</p>

<p>2. A Benevolence in many cases may divide a whole Nation
into parties, or at least make the strength of Parties too
well known to such as need not know it: and withall it may
(on the contrary and upon design) disguize the same, and
elude the measures which the Governours thought to have taken
by such an exploratory artifice.</p>

<p>3. Some men may have particular reasons to contribute
large, <em>viz.</em> complacency with, and hopes of being repaired by
the favour of some Grandee, who favours the business, and
the very same may make to the prejudice of others.</p>

<p>4. Men of sinking Estates, (who nevertheless love to live
high, and appear splendid, and such who make themselves
friends, (by their hospitality paid for, in effect by others)
enough to be protected, even from Justice) do often upon
this occasion of Benevolence set extravagant Examples unto
others, who have laboured hardly for what they have; those
not caring what they pay, because it encreaseth their credit,
to borrow the more, so as at length the whole burthen of such
Bankrupts Benevolence, lights upon the frugal Patriots, by
whom the Publique Weal subsists.</p>

<br />
<span class="chap-sum"><em>Of Penalties.</em></span></h2>


<p class="drop-capy">The usual Penalties are Death, Mutilations, Imprisonment,
Publick disgrace, Corporal transient pains, and great
Tortures, besides Pecuniary Mulcts. <ins class="corrx" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Erratum applied">On</ins> which last we shall
most insist, speaking of the others but in order to examine
whether they may not be commuted for these.</p>

<p>2. There be some certain Crimes, for which the Law of
God appoints death; and these must be punished with it, unless
we say that those were but the Civil Laws of the Jewish<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
Commonwealth, although given by God himself; of which
opinion certainly most modern States are, in as much as they
punish not Adulteries, &amp;c. with death, as among the Jewes,
and yet punish small Thefts with Death instead of multiple
reparation.</p>

<p>3. Upon this supposition we shall venture to offer; whether
the reason of simple Death be not to punish incorrigible
Committers of great faults?</p>

<p>4. Of publick Death with Torments, to affright men from
Treasons, which cause the deaths and miseries of many thousand
innocent and useful people?</p>

<p>5. Of Death secretly executed, to punish secret and unknown
Crimes, such as Publick Executions would teach to the
World? Or else to suffocate betimes some dangerous Novelties
in Religion, which the patient suffering of the worst
man would much spread and encourage.</p>

<p>6. Mutilations suppose of Ears, Nose, &amp;c. are used for
perpetual disgrace, as standing in the Pillory is for temporary
and transient; which and such other punishments have (by
the way) made some corrigible offenders, to become desperate
and incurable.</p>

<p>7. Mutilations of parts as of Fingers, are proper to disable
such as have abused their dextrous use of them, by Pocket-picking,
Counterfeiting of Seals and Writings, &amp;c. Mutilations
of other parts, may serve to punish and prevent Adulteries,
Rapes, Incests, &amp;c. And the smaller Corporal pains,
serve to punish those, who can pay no pecuniary mulcts.</p>

<p>8. Imprisonment seems rather to be the punishments of
suspected then guilty persons, and such as by their carriage
give the Magistrate occasion to think, either they have done
some smaller particular Crime, as Thefts, &amp;c. or that they
would commit greater, as Treasons and Seditions. But where
Imprisonment is not a securing men untill their Trialls,
but a sentence after Triall, it seems to me proper onely
to seclude such men from conversation, whose Discourses are
bewitching, and Practices infectious, and in whom neverthelesse
remains some hopes of their future Amendments,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
or usefulnesse for some service not yet appearing.</p>

<p>9. As for perpetual Imprisonment by sentence, it seems
but the same with death it self, to be executed by nature it
self, quickened with such Diseases, as close living, sadness, solitude,
and reflections upon a past and better condition, doth
commonly beget: Nor do men sentenced hereunto live longer,
though they be longer in dying.</p>

<p>10. Here we are to remember in consequence of our opinion,
[That Labour is the Father and active principle of
Wealth, as Lands are the Mother] that the State by killing,
mutilating, or imprisoning their members, do withall punish
themselves; wherefore such punishments ought (as much as
possible) to be avoided and commuted for pecuniary mulcts,
which will encrease labour and publick wealth.</p>

<p>11. Upon which account, why should not a man of Estate,
found guilty of man-slaughter, rather pay a certain proportion
of his whole Estate, then be burnt in the hand?</p>

<p>12. Why should not insolvent Thieves be rather punished
with slavery then death? so as being slaves they may be forced
to as much labour, and as cheap fare, as nature will endure,
and thereby become as two men added to the Commonwealth,
and not as one taken away from it; for if <em>England</em> be under-peopled,
(suppose by half) I say that next to the bringing in of
as many more as now are, is the making these that are, to do
double the work which now they do; that is, to make some
slaves; but of this elsewhere.</p>

<p>13. And why should not the solvent Thieves and Cheats
be rather punished with multiple Restitutions then Death,
Pillory, Whipping? &amp;c. But it will be asked, with how manifold
Restitutions should picking a pocket (for example) be
punished? I say, ’twere good in order to the solution hereof,
to enquire of some candid Artists in that Trade, how often
they are taken one time with another practising in this work?
If but once in ten times, then to restore even but seven-fold,
would be a fair profit; and to restore but ten-fold, were but
an even lay; wherefore to restore twenty-fold, that is, double to
the hazard, is rather the true <em>ratio</em> and measure of punishment
by double reparation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span></p>

<p>14. And surely the restoring two, three, four, and seven-fold
mentioned in <em>Moses</em> Law must be thus understood, or else
a man might make thieving a very fair and lawful profession.</p>

<p>15. The next question is, in such multiple Restitutions
how many parts should be given to the sufferer. To which I
answer, never above one, and scarce that, to oblige him to
more care, and self-preservation, with three <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'parts to discoveers'">parts to discoverers</ins>,
and the rest to publick uses.</p>

<p>16. Thirdly, In the case of Fornications, most of the punishments
not made by pecuniary mulcts and commuted, are
but shame, and that too but towards some few persons, which
shame for ever after obdurates the Offender, what ever it
work upon such whose fames are yet intire: Of all which men
take little consideration, standing upon the brink of such precipices
as makes them giddy; and when they are in danger of
such faults as are rather madnesses, distempers, and alienations
of the minde and reason, as also insurrections of the passions,
then deliberate acts of the understanding.</p>

<p>17. Moreover, according to that Axiom of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">In quo quis peccat,
in eodem puniatur</i>; if the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Ratio formalis</i> of the sin of
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Concubitus Vagi</i>, be the hindering of procreation, let those
who by their miscarriages of this kinde are guilty thereof, repair
unto the State the misse of another pair of hands with the
double labour of their own, or which is all one, by a pecuniary
mulct; and this is the practice of some wise States in punishing
what they will never be able to prevent: Nor doth
the Gospel specifie any punishment in this world, onely declaring
they shall not be received into the joyes of the next.</p>

<p>18. I could instance in more particulars, but if what I have
already said be reasonable, this little is enough; if not, then
all the rest would be too little also: wherefore I shall adde
but one instance more, as most suitable to our present times
and occasions, which is the way of punishing Heterodox Professors
of Religion.</p>

<p>19. That the Magistrate may punish false Believers, if he
believe he shall offend God in forbearing it, is true; for the
same reasons that men give for Liberty of Conscience, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
universal tolleration; and on the other side, that he may permit
false Worships, seems clearly at least by the practice of all
States, who allow Ambassadours their freedom (be <ins class="corrx" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Erratum applied">their</ins> Worship
never so abominable) even when they come to negociate
but upon temporal and small matters.</p>

<p>20. Wherefore, since the Magistrate may allow or connive
at such Worships as himself thinks fit, and yet may also punish;
and since by Death, Mutilations, and imprisonments of
the Subjects, the State not onely punisheth it self, but spreadeth
the Pseudodoxies; it follows, that pecuniary Mulcts are
the fittest wayes of checking the wantonness of men in this
particular: forasmuch as that course favours of no bitterness
at all, but rather argues a desire to indulge, provided such indulgence
may consist with the indempnity of the State; for
no <ins class="corrx" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Erratum applied">Heterodox believer</ins> will desire to be tollerated longer then he
keeps the Publick Peace; the which if he means to do, he
cannot take it ill of the Magistrate, to keep him steddy unto
that his duty, nor grudge to contribute towards so much charge
for that purpose as himself occasions.</p>

<p>21. Moreover, as there seems a reason for indulging some
conscientious misbelievers, so there is as much for being severe
towards Hypocrites, especially such as abuse holy Religion
to cloak and vizzard worldly ends: Now what more easie
and yet effectual way is there to discern between these two,
then well proportioned pecuniary mulcts? for who desiring
to serve God without fear, and labouring ten hours <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">per diem</i>
at his Calling, would not labour one hour more for <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'such a freedon'">such a freedom</ins>?
even as religious men spend an hour <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">per diem</i> more then
the looser sort do at their Devotions; or who <ins class="corrx" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Erratum applied">wearing</ins> Cloth
of one and twenty shillings the yard, would not be contented
with that of twenty shillings, for the same advantage of his
liberty in Worship? Those that kick at this, being unwilling
either to do or suffer for God, for whose sake they pretend
so much.</p>

<p>22. It may be here objected, that although some bad Religions
might be tollerated, yet that all may not, <em>viz.</em> such as
consist not with the Civil Peace. To which I answer,</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span></p>

<p>First; that there is no Schisme or Separation be it never so
small, consistent with that unity and peace as could be wisht;
nor none so perfectly conscientious, but may also be civilly
most pernicious: For that <em>Venner</em> and his Complices acted upon
internal motives, the most free exposing of themselves to
death may evince; and yet their holding the King to be an
Usurper upon the Throne and Right of Jesus Christ was a
Civil mischief neither to be pardoned or parallel’d.</p>

<p>23. And yet on the other hand there is no Pseudodoxy so
great, but may be muzzled from doing much harm in the State,
without either Death, Imprisonment, or Mutilation: To
make short, no opinion can be more dangerous, then to disbelieve
the immortality of the Soul, as rendring man a beast,
and without conscience, or fear of committing any evil, if he
can but elude the penalties of humane Laws made against it,
and letting men loose to all evil thoughts and designs whereof
man can take no notice: Now I say, that even this Misbeliever
may be adæquately punished if he be kept as a beast, be
proprietor of nothing, as making no conscience how he gets;
be never admitted in Evidence or Testimony, as under no Obligation
to speak truth; be excluded all Honours and Offices,
as caring onely for himself, not the protecting of others;
and be withall kept to extream bodily labour, the profit whereof
to the State is the pecuniary Mulct we speak of, though
the greatest.</p>

<p>24. As for opinions less horrible then this, the Mulct may
be fitted to each of them respectively, according to the measure
of danger which the Magistrate apprehends from their
allowance, and the charge necessary to prevent it.</p>

<p>25. And now we are speaking of the wayes how to prevent
and correct Heterodoxies in Religion, which we have hitherto
done by designing punishments for the erring sheep, I think
it not amiss to adde, That in all these cases the Shepherds
themselves should not wholly scape free: For if in this Nation
there be such abundance of Free-Schools, and of liberall
Maintenance provided in our Universities and elsewhere for
instructing more then enough in all such learning as is fit to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
defend the established Religion, together with superabundant
Libraries for that purpose. Moreover, if the Church-preferments
be so numerous and ample both for Wealth, Honour,
and Power, as scarce any where more; it seems strange that
when by the laziness, formality, ignorance, and loose lives of
our Pastours, the sheep have gone astray, grown scabbed, or
have been devoured by Wolves and Foxes, that the Remedy
of all this should be onely sought by frighting those that have
strayed from ever returning again, and by tearing off as well
the skins as the wool of those that are scabbed; whereas Almighty
God will rather require the blood even of them that
have been devoured, from the shepheards themselves.</p>

<p>26. Wherefore if the Minister should lose part of the
Tythes of those whom he suffers to <ins class="corrx" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Erratum applied">defect</ins> from the Church,
(the defector not saving, but the State wholly gaining them)
and the defector paying some pecuniary Mulct for his Schisme,
and withall himself defraying the charge of his new particular
Church and Pastorage, me thinks the burthen would be thus
more equally born.</p>

<p>27. Besides, the judicious world do not believe our Clergy
can deserve the vaste preferments they have, onely because they
preach, give a better accompt of Opinions concerning Religion
then others, or can express their conceptions in the
words of the Fathers, or the Scriptures, &amp;c. Whereas certainly
the great honour we give them, is for being patterns of
holiness, for shewing by their own self-denials, mortifications,
and austerities, that ’tis possible for us to imitate them in the
precepts of God; for if it were but for their bare Pulpit-discourses,
some men might think there is ten thousand times as
much already printed as can be necessary, and as good as any
that ever hereafter may be expected. And it is much suspected,
that the Discipline of the Cloisters hath kept up the
Roman Religion, which the Luxury of the Cardinals and
Prelates might have destroyed.</p>

<p>28. The substance therefore of all we have said in this discourse
concerning the Church is, that it would make much
for its peace, if the Nursery of Ministers be not too big, that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
Austerities in the Priests lives would reconcile them to the
people; and that it is not unreasonable, that when the whole
Church suffers by the defection of her Members, that the Pastours
of it by bearing a small part should be made sensible of
the loss; the manner and measures of all which I leave unto
those unto whom it belongs.</p>

<p>29. Concerning Penalties and Penal Laws I shall adde but
this, that the abuse of them is, when they are made not to keep
men from sin, but to draw them into punishment; and when the
Executers of them keep them hid until a fault be done, and then
shew them terrible to the poor immalicious offender: Just
like Centinels, who never shew men the advertisements against
pissing near their Guards, till they have catcht them by the
coats for the forfeiture they claim.</p>

<span class="chap-sum"><em>Of Monopolies and Offices.</em></span></h2>


<p class="drop-capy">Monopoly (as the word signifies) is the sole selling power,
which whosoever hath can vend the commodity
whereupon he hath this power, either qualified as himself
pleases, or at what price he pleaseth, or both, within the limits
of his Commission.</p>

<p>2. The great example of a Monopoly is the King of <em>France</em>
his Gabel upon Salt, whereby he sells that for sixty which
costs him but one; now Salt being a thing of universal use
to all degrees of men, and scarce more to the poor then the
rich, it seems to be of the same effect with the simplest Poll-money
abovementioned, in case all men spent equally of it, or
if men be forced to take it whether they spend it or not, as in
some places they are. But if men spend or eat Salt unequally,
as they commonly do, nor are bound to take or pay for more
then they spend, <ins class="corrx" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Erratum applied">then it is</ins> no other then an accumulative Excize,
especially if the salt be all of one uniform goodness,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
otherwise it is a distinct species of Leavy, <em>viz.</em> a Monopoly.</p>

<p>3. The use or pretence of instituting a Monopoly is,</p>

<p>First, Right of Invention; forasmuch as the Laws do reward
Inventions, by granting them a Monopoly of them for
a certain time; (as here in <em>England</em> for fourteen years) for
thereby the Inventor is rewarded more or less according to
the acceptance which his Invention findes amongst men.</p>

<p>Where note by the way, that few new Inventions were ever
rewarded by a Monopoly; for although the Inventor often-times
drunk with the opinion of his own merit, thinks all the
world will invade and incroach upon him, yet I have observed,
that the generality of men will scarce be hired to make
use of new practices, which themselves <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'have not throughly'">have not thoroughly</ins>
tried, and which length of time hath not vindicated from latent
inconveniences; so as when a new Invention is first propounded,
in the beginning every man objects, and the poor
Inventor runs the Gantloop of all petulent wits; every man
finding his several flaw, no man approving it, unless mended
according to his own advice: Now not one of an hundred
out-lives this torture, and those that do, are at length so
changed by the various contrivances of others, that not any
one man can pretend to the Invention of the whole, nor well
agree about their respective shares in the parts. And moreover,
this commonly is so long a doing, that the poor Inventor
is either dead, or disabled by the debts contracted to pursue
his design; and withall railed upon as a Projector, or worse, by
those who joyned their money in partnership with his wit; so
as the said Inventor and his pretences are wholly lost and
vanisht.</p>

<p>Secondly, a Monopoly may be of real use for a time, <em>viz.</em>
at the first introducing of a new Manufacture, wherein is
much nicety to make it well, and which the generality of men
cannot judge of as to the performance. As for example; suppose
there were some most approved Medicament which one
certain man could make most exactly well, although several
others could also make the same less perfectly: in this case this
same chief Artist may be allowed a Monopoly for a time, <em>viz.</em><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
until others have had experience enough under him, how to
make the Medicament as well as himself. First, because the
world may not have the Medicament variously made, when as
they can neither discern the difference by their senses, nor
judge of the effects thereof <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">à posteriori</i>, by their reasons. Secondly,
because others may be fully instructed by him that can
best do it; and thirdly, because he may have a reward for such
his communications: But forasmuch as by Monopolies of this
kinde, great Leavies are seldom made, they are scarce pertinent
to our design.</p>

<p>Offices instituted by the State with Fees of their own appointment,
are of parallel nature to Monopolies; the one
relating to actions and employments as the other to things, and
have the same to be said for and against them as Monopolies
have.</p>

<p>As a Kingdom encreaseth and flourisheth, so doth variety
of things, of actions, and even of words encrease also; for
we see that the language of the most flourishing Empires was
ever the most copious and elegant, and that of mountainous
Cantons the contrary: Now as the actions of this Kingdom
encreased, so did the Offices (that is, the power and faculty of
solely executing and performing the said actions) encrease
likewise; and on the contrary, as the business of Offices encreased,
so did the difficulty and danger of discharging them
amiss decrease proportionably: from whence ’tis come to pass,
that the Offices which at their first erecting were not performed
but by the ablest, most inventive, and versatile Instruments,
(such as could wrestle with all emergent difficulties,
and collect Rules and Axioms out of the Series of their own
Observations, (with reference to the various casualties of
their employments) whereby to direct Posterity) are now
performed by the most ordinary, formal, pack-horse Deputies
and Sub-Deputies.</p>

<p>And whereas at first such large Fees were allowed as
(considering even the paucity of them which might then be
received) should compensate the Art, Trust, and Industry of
the Administratour; <ins class="corrx" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Erratum applied">yet the said</ins> large Fees are still continued,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
although the skill and trust be lessened, and the number
of the said Fees so extreamly multiplyed: so as now the profits
of such <ins class="corrx" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Erratum applied">Offices</ins> (being become cleer, and the work so
easie as any man is capable of it, even those that never saw it,)
are bought and sold for Years or Lives, as any other Annuity
may be; and withal, the splendor arising from the easie gaines
of those places in Courts of Justice, is called the Flourishing
of the Law, which certainly flourisheth best, when the Professors
and Ministers of it have least to do. And moreover,
when the burthen and uselesness of such an Office is taken notice
of, ’tis nevertheless spared as a Subjects Freehold in favour
of him that bought it.</p>

<p>Of these Offices are many in this Nation, and such as might
be a Revenue to the King, either by their Annual profits, or
the Sale of them for many years together. And these are the
Offices that are properly Saleable, <em>viz.</em> where the Fees are
large, as appointed when the number of them was few, and also
numerous, as multiplying upon the increase of business, and
where the business is onely the labour of the meanest men:
length of time having made all the work so easie, and found
out security against all the frauds, breaches of trust, and male-administrations,
whereunto the infancies of those places were
obnoxious.</p>

<p>These Offices <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'are thererore Taxes'">are therefore Taxes</ins> upon such as can or will
not avoid the passing through them, and are born as men endure
and run themselves into the mischiefs of Duelling, the
which are very great, which side soever prevails; for certainly
men do not alwayes go to Law to obtain right, or prevent
wrong, which judicious neighbours might perform as well as a
Jury of no abler men; and men might tell the Judge himself
the merits of their Cause, as well as now they instruct their
Councel. This therefore of Offices is a voluntary Tax upon
contentious men, as Excize upon Drink is, to good Fellows
to love it.</p>

<br />
<span class="chap-sum"><em>Of Tythes.</em></span></h2>


<p class="drop-capy">The Word Tythes being the same with Tenths, signifie
of it self no more then the proportion of the <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Excisum</span>,
or part retrenched, as if Customs upon imported and exported
Commodities should be called by the name of Twentieths,
as it is sometimes called Tunnage and Poundage; wherefore
it remains to say, that Tythes in this place, do together with the
said proportion, consignifie the use of it, <em>viz.</em> the maintenance of
the Clergy, as also the matter or substance out of which this
Maintenance is cut, <em>viz.</em> the immediate fruit of the Land and
Waters, or the proceed of mens Labour, Art, and Stock laid
out upon them. It signifies also the manner of paying it, <em>viz.</em>
in <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">specie</i>, and not (but upon special and voluntary causes) in
money.</p>

<p>2. We said the matter of Tythes, was the immediate Fruits
of the Earth, <em>viz.</em> of Grain as soon as ’tis ready to be removed
from the ground that bare it; and not of Bread which is
Corn thresht, winnowed, ground, tempered with liquor and
baked.</p>

<p>3. ’Tis also the second choice out of the young of multiparous
Cattle taken in <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">specie</i>, so soon as the said Younglings
can subsist without their Dams, or else a Composition in Money
<ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'for the Uniparons'">for the Uniparous</ins>.</p>

<p>4. ’Tis Wool, so soon as it is shorn; ’tis Fowl and Fish,
where Fowling and Fishing is rather a Trade then a meer Recreation,
&amp; <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">sic de cæteris</i>.</p>

<p>5. Moreover, in great Cities Tythes are a kinde of
composition in Money for the labour and profit of the Artisans
who work upon the materials which have paid Tythes
before.</p>

<p>6. Tythes therefore encrease within any Territory, as the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
labour of that Countrey increases; and labour doth or ought
to increase as the people do; now within four hundred years
the people of <em>England</em> are about quadrupled, as doubling every
two hundred years, and the proportion of the Rent of all
the Lands in <em>England</em> is about the fourth part of the Expence
of the people in it, so as the other three parts is labour and
stock.</p>

<p>7. Wherefore the Tythes now should be twelve times as
good as they were four hundred years ago; which the rates of
Benefices in the Kings books do pretty well shew, by comparing
of times; something of this should be abated because
the proportion between the proceed of Lands and Labour
do vary as the hands of Labourers vary: Wherefore we shall
rather say, that the Tythes are but six times as good now as
four hundred years ago, that is, that the Tythes now would
pay six times as many Labourers, or feed six times as many
mouthes, as the Tythes four hundred years ago would have
done.</p>

<p>8. Now if there were not onely as many Parishes then as
now, more Priests in every Parish, and also more Religious
Men who were also Priests, and the Religion of those times
being more operose, and fuller of work then now, by reason
of Confessions, Holydayes, Offices, &amp;c. more in those dayes
then now, (the great work in these dayes being a compendious
teaching above a thousand at once without much particular
Confession and Catechising, or trouble about the Dead), it
seems clear, that the Clergy now is far richer then heretofore;
and that to be a Clergy-man then was a kinde of a Mortification,
whereas now (praised be God) ’tis matter of splendour
and magnificence; unless any will say, that there were golden
Priests when the Chalices were wood, and but wooden Priests
when the Chalices were gold; or that Religion best flourisheth
when the Priests are most mortified, as was before said of
the Law, which best flourisheth when Lawyers have least to do.</p>

<p>9. But what ever the increase of the Churches Goods are,
I grudge it them not; onely wish, that they would take a
course to enjoy it with safety and peace to themselves; whereof<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
one is, not to breed more Churchmen then the Benefices
as they now stand <ins class="corrx" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Erratum applied">shared</ins> out, will receive; that is to say, if
there be places but for about twelve thousand in <em>England</em> and
<em>Wales</em>, it will not be safe to breed up 24000. Ministers, upon a
view or conceipt that the Church means otherwise distributed
might suffice them all; for then the twelve thousand
which are unprovided for, will seek wayes how to get themselves
a livelihood; which they cannot do more easily then by
perswading the people, that the twelve thousand Incumbents
do poison or starve their souls, and misguide them in their
way to Heaven: Which needy men upon a strong temptation
will do effectually; we having observed, that Lecturers being
such a sort of Supernumeraries, have preached more times in
a week, more hours in the day, and with greater vehemence
every time then the Incumbents could afford to do; for <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Graculus
esuriens in Cælum, jusseris, ibit.</i> Now this vehemence, this
pains, this zeal, and this living upon particular donations,
makes the people think, that those who act them are withall
more Orthodox, nay better assisted from God then the others.
Now let any man judge, whether men reputed to be inspired
will not get help to lift themselves into Church-livings, &amp;c.
But these things are too plain from the latest experiences.</p>

<p>10. Now you will ask, how shall that be done, or how may
we know how to adjust our Nursery to our Orchard? To
which I answer, that if there be twelve thousand Church-livings
in <em>England</em>, Dignitaries included, then that about four
hundred being sent forth <em>per ann.</em> into the Vineyard, may keep
it well served, without luxuriency; for according to the Mortality-Bill-observation,
about that number will dye yearly out
of twelve thousand Adult-persons, such as Ministers are as to
age, and ought to be as well as to speculative knowledge, as
practical experience, both of themselves and others.</p>

<p>11. But I have digressed, my main scope being to explain
the nature of the Tax of Tythes; nevertheless since the end
of such explanation is but to perswade men to bear quietly so
much Tax as is necessary, and not to kick against the pricks;
and since the end of that again, and the end of all else we are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
to do, is but to preserve the publick Peace, I think I have not
been impertinent in inserting this little Advertisement, making
so much for the Peace of our <em>Jerusalem</em>.</p>

<p>12. But to return to Tythes as a Tax or Levy, I say that in
<em>England</em> it is none, whatsoever it might be or seem to be in the
first Age of its Institution; nor will the Kings Quit-rents in
<em>Ireland</em> as they are properly none now, seem any in the next
Age, when every man will proportion his Expence to the remainder
of his own Rent after the King is paid his; for ’tis
surprize and the suddenness of the Charge, which a Tax supervenient
to a mans other expences and issues makes, that
renders it a burthen, and that intolerable to such as will not
understand it, making men even to take up Arms to withstand
it; that is, leap out of the Frying-pan upon earth into the fire
even of hell, which is War and the <ins class="corrx" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Erratum applied">consequences</ins> thereof.</p>

<p>13. Now Tythes being no Tax, I speak of it but as the
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">modus</i> or pattern of a Tax, affirming it to be next to one, the
most equal and indifferent which can be appointed in order to
defray the publick Charge of the whole Nation as well as
that of the Church; for hereby is collected a proportion of all
the Corn, Cattle, Fish, Fowl, Fruit, Wool, Honey, Wax, Oyl,
Hemp, and Flax of the Nation, as a result of the Lands, Art,
Labour, and Stock which produced them; onely it is scarce regular
in respect of Housing, Cloth, Drinks, Leather, Feathers,
and the several Manufactures of them; insomuch, as if
the difference of Tythes which the Countrey payes in proportion
to the City, were now <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">de novo</i> to be established, I do
not see what in likelihood would sooner cause a grand sedition
about it.</p>

<p>14. The payment of an <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">aliquot</i> part to the King out of the
same things as now pay Tythes, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">in specie</i>, would have <ins class="corrx" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Erratum applied">an</ins> inconvenience,
because the Kings Rents would be like the Dividend
in Colledges, <em>viz.</em> higher or lower according to the prices of
those Commodities, unless the said inequality in Colledges happen
by reason of the fewness of particulars, according to the
market rates whereof, their Rents are paid in money; whereas
the whole of all the particulars might well enough ballance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
each other, a dear or <ins class="corrx" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Erratum applied">plentiful year</ins> being but an appellation <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">secundum
quid</i>, <em>viz.</em> with reference as to Corn onely, as the chief
food of the multitude; whereas ’tis likely, that the same
causes which makes Corn scarce may make other things in
plenty of no less use to the King; as repairing in one thing
what he wants in another.</p>

<p>15. Another inconvenience would be that which was observed
in <em>Ireland</em>, when the Ministery were paid by Sallary,
and the Tythes in kinde paid to the State; who because they
could not actually receive them <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">in specie</i>, let them at farm to
the most bidder; in the Transaction whereof was much juggling,
combination, and collusion, which perhaps might have
been remedied, had not that course been used but as a sudden
temporary shift, without intention of continuing it.</p>

<p>16. The third inconvenience is, that abovementioned, <em>viz.</em>
the necessity of another way of Tax, to take in the Manufactures
of those Commodities which pay the Tax of Tythes;
whereas possibly there is a way of Tax equal in its own nature,
and which needs not to be pieced up by any other; so as
the Officers about that may have a full employment, and none
others wanted, whose wide intervals of leasure shall make them
seem Drones, as they are also the Caterpillers of any State.</p>

<span class="chap-sum"><em>Of several smaller wayes of levying Money.</em></span></h2>


<p class="drop-capy">When the people are weary of any one sort of Tax,
presently some Projector propounds another, and
gets himself audience, by affirming he can propound a way
how all the publick charge may be born without the way that
is. As for example, if a Land-tax be the present distasted way,
and the people weary of it, then he offers to do the business
without such a Land-tax, and propound either a Poll-money,
Excize, or the institution of some new Office or Monopoly,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
and hereby draws some or other to hearken to him; which is
readily enough done by those who are not in the places of profit
relating to the way of Levies in use, but hope to make
themselves Offices in the new Institution.</p>

<p>2. I shall enumerate a few of the smaller wayes which I
have observed in several places of <em>Europe</em>, <em>viz.</em></p>

<p>First, in some places the State is common Cashier for all or
most moneys, as where Banks are, thereby gaining the interest
of as much money as is deposited in their hands.</p>

<p>Secondly, Sometimes the State is the common Usurer, as
where Loan Banks, and <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">montes pietatis</i> are in use, and might be
more copiously and effectually where Registers of Lands are
kept.</p>

<p>Thirdly, Sometimes the State is or may be Common Ensurer,
either upon the danger onely of Enemies at sea, according
to the supposed primitive end of our Customs in <em>England</em>,
or else of the casualties of the Enemy, Weather, Sea, and Vessel
taken together.</p>

<p>Fourthly, Sometimes the State hath the whole sale and
benefit of certain Commodities, as of Amber in the Duke of
<em>Brandenburghs</em> Countrey, Tobacco formerly in <em>Ireland</em>, Salt
in <em>France</em>, &amp;c.</p>

<p>Fifthly, Sometimes the State is common Beggar, as ’tis almost
in <em>Holland</em>, where particular Charity seems only to serve for the
relief of concealed wants, and to save these wanting from the
shame of discovering their poverty, and not so much to relieve
any wants that are declared, and already publickly
known.</p>

<p>Sixthly, In some places the State is the sole Guardian of
Minors, Lunaticks, and Idiots.</p>

<p>Seventhly, In some other Countreys the State sets up and
maintains Play-houses, and publick Entertainments, giving
Sallaries to the Actors, but receiving the bulk of the profit to
themselves.</p>

<p>Eighthly, In some places, Houses are ensured from fire by
the State at a small Rent <em>per annum</em> upon each.</p>

<p>Ninthly, In some places Tolls are taken upon passage over<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
Bridges, Causeys, and Ferries built and maintained at the
Publick Charge.</p>

<p>Tenthly, In some places men that dye are obliged to leave
a certain pittance to the publick, the same is practised in other
places upon Marriages, and may be in others upon Births.</p>

<p>Eleventhly, In some places strangers especially Jews, are
particularly taxed; which may be good in over-peopled Countreys,
though bad in the contrary case.</p>

<p>3. As for Jews, they may well bear somewhat extraordinary,
because they seldom eat and drink with Christians, hold
it no disparagement to live frugally, and even sordidly among
themselves, by which way alone they become able to
under-sell any other Traders, to elude the Excize, which
bears but according to mens Expences; as also other Duties,
by dealing so much in Bills of Exchange, Jewels, and
Money, and by practising of several frauds with more impunity
then others; for by their being at home every where,
and yet no where they become responsible almost for nothing.</p>

<p>4. Twelfthly, There have been in our times, wayes of levying
an <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">aliquot</i> part of mens Estates, as a Fifth, and Twentieth,
<em>viz.</em> of their Estates real and personal, yea of their Offices,
Faculties, and imaginary Estates also, in and about which way
may be so much fraud, collusion, oppression, and trouble, some
purposely getting themselves taxed to gain more trust: Others
bribing to be taxed low, and it being impossible to check or
examine, or trace these Collections by the print of any footsteps
they leave, (such as the Harths of Chimneys are) that I
have not patience to speak more against it; daring rather
conclude without more ado, in the words of our Comick to
be naught, yea exceeding naught, very abominable, and not
good.</p>

<span class="chap-sum"><em>Of raising, depressing, or embasing of Money.</em></span></h2>


<p class="drop-capy">Sometimes <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'it hath hapned'">it hath happened</ins>, that States (I know not by
what raw advice) have raised or embased their money,
hoping thereby, as it were, to multiply it, and make it pass for
more then it did before; that is, to purchase more commodity
or labour with it: All which indeed and in truth, amounts
to no more then a Tax, upon such People unto whom the
State is indebted, or a defalkation of what is due; as also the
like burthen upon all that live upon Pensions, established
Rents, Annuities, Fees, Gratuities, &amp;c.</p>

<p>2. To explain this fully, one might lanch out into the
deep Ocean of all the Mysteries concerning Money, which is
done for other ends elsewhere; nevertheless I shall do it the
best I can, by expounding the reasons <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">pro &amp; contrà</i> for embasing
and raising of Money: and first of embasing.</p>

<p>3. Copper or Tin Money made <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ad valorem</i> in its matter, is
no embasing; the same being onely cumbersom and baser then
silver money, onely because less convenient and portable.</p>

<p>And Copper money <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ad valorem</i> in workmanship and matter
both together; (such as on which the Effigies and Scutcheon
are so curiously graven and impressed, as the moneys seem rather
<ins class="corrx" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Erratum applied">Medalls</ins>) is not embasing, unless the numbers of such
pieces be excessive, (the measures whereof I shall not set
down, until I shall hereafter propound the fittest Sections of
the abstracted pound into which I would have money coyned,
and determine how many pieces of each Section should be in
an hundred pound) for in case of such excess, the workmanship
being of no other use but to look upon, becomes base by
its being too common.</p>

<p>4. Nor are such Tokens base as are coyned for Exchange in
retailing by particular men, (if such men be responsible and
able to take them back, and give Silver for them.)</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span></p>

<p>5. But that Gold I count to be embased, which hath more
allay either of Copper or Silver in it, then serves to correct
its too great natural softness and flexibility, whereby it wears
too fast in Money: And that Silver I reckon also embased,
wherein is commixed more Copper then will sufficiently
toughen it, and save it from cracking under the Hammer,
Press, or Mill that must coin it, or the like.</p>

<p>6. Base Money is therefore such as Dutch Shillings, Stivers,
French Soulz, Irish Bon-galls, &amp;c. and for the most part <ins class="corrx" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Erratum applied">consisting
of great</ins> pieces, though of small value. To answer the first
reason or pretence of making them, which is, that the said
Pieces might be more bulky, handleable, and the silver in them
less apt to be lost or worn away.</p>

<p>7. The other reason (besides that of allay which we must
allow in the Measures abovementioned) is to save it from being
melted down by Goldsmiths and Bullioners, or exported
by strangers; neither of which can happen but to their loss:
for suppose a Stiver of two pence, had a penny of pure silver,
if the Bullioner melts it for the sake of the silver onely,
in the separation he shall lose the Copper and charge of refining
the Silver; nor will strangers export it into places
where the local value of the Piece perisheth, the intrinsick
leaving him to loss.</p>

<p>7. Now the reasons against this kinde of Money are, first
the greater danger of falsification, because the colour, sound,
and weight by which men (without the test) guess at the
goodness of the material of Money is too much confounded,
for the vulgar (whom it concerns) to make use of them for
their marks and guides in the business.</p>

<p>8. Secondly, In case small pieces of this Money, <em>viz.</em> pieces
of two pence should happen to be raised or depressed twelve,
fifteen, or sixteen <em>per cent.</em> then there will be a certain loss by
reason of the fractions, which the vulgar cannot reckon: As
for example, if such Money were depressed but ten, eleven, or
twelve <em>per cent.</em> then the two pence piece would be worth but
three half pence, which is twenty five <em>per cent.</em> and so of other
proportions.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span></p>

<p>9. Thirdly, In case the Inconvenience of this Money should
be so great as to necessitate a new Coinage of it, then will
happen all the losses we mentioned before in melting it down
by Bullioners.</p>

<p>10. Fourthly, If the two pence piece contained but
<span class="blkb">
  <span class="blka">1.</span>
  <span class="blka over">5.</span>
</span><sup>th.</sup> part
of the Silver usually in a shilling, then Dealers would have
fifteen pence paid in this money for the same Commodity, for
which they would take a shilling in Standard Silver.</p>

<p>11. Raising of Money is either the cutting the pound <em>Troy</em>
of Standard Silver into more pieces then formerly, as into
above sixty, whereas heretofore the same was made but into
twenty, and yet both sorts called shillings, or else calling the
money already made by higher names: The reasons or pretences
given for such raising are these, <em>viz.</em> That the raising of
Money will bring it in, and the material thereof more plentifully;
for trial whereof suppose one shilling were proclaimed
to be worth two, what other effect could this have, then the
raising of all Commodities unto a double price? Now if it
were proclaimed, That Labourers Wages, &amp;c. should not
rise at all upon this raising of Money, then would this Act be
as onely a Tax upon the said Labourers, as forcing them to
lose half their wages, which would not be onely unjust but
impossible, unless they could live with the said half, (which is
not to be supposed) for then the Law that appoints such Wages
were ill made, which should allow the Labourer but just
wherewithall to live; for if you allow double, then he works
but half so much as he could have done, and otherwise would;
which is a loss to the Publick of the fruit of so much labour.</p>

<p>12. But suppose the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Quart <ins class="corrx" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Erratum applied">d’ Ecus</ins></i> of <em>France</em> commonly
esteemed worth eighteen pence were raised to three shillings,
then ’tis true, that all the Moneys of <em>England</em> would be indeed
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Quart d’ Ecus</i> pieces; but as true, that all the English Money
would be carried away, and that our <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Quart d’ Ecus</i> would
contain but half so much Bullion as our own money did; so
that raising of Money may indeed change the <em>species</em>, but
with so much loss as the Forreign Pieces were raised unto,
above their intrinsick value.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span></p>

<p>13. But for remedy of this, suppose we raised the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Quart d’
Ecus</i> double, and prohibited the Exportation of our own money
in Exchange thereof. I answer, that such a Prohibition
is nugatory, and impossible to be executed; and if it were not,
yet the raising of the said <em>species</em> would but make us sell the
Commodities bought with raised <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Quart d’ Ecus</i>, in effect but
at half the usual rate, which unto them that want such commodities
will as well yield the full; so that abating our prices,
will as well allure strangers to buy extraordinary proportions
of our Commodities, as raising their money will do: But
neither that, nor abating the price will make strangers use
more of our Commodities then they want; for although the
first year they should carry away an unuseful and superfluous
proportion, yet afterwards they would take so much the less.</p>

<p>14. If this be true, as in substance it is, why then have so
many wise States in several ancient, as well as modern times
frequently practised this Artifice, as a means to draw in money
into their respective Dominions?</p>

<p>I answer, that something is to be attributed to the stupidity
and ignorance of the people, who cannot of a sudden understand
this matter: for I finde many men wise enough, who
though they be well informed that raising of money signifies
little, yet cannot suddenly digest it. As for example, an unengaged
person who had money in his purse in <em>England</em>, and
should hear that a shilling was made fourteen pence in <em>Ireland</em>,
would more readily run thither to buy Land then before; not
suddenly apprehending, that for the same Land which he might
have bought before for six years Purchase, he shall now pay
seven. Nor will Sellers in <em>Ireland</em> of a sudden apprehend
cause to raise their Land proportionally, but will at least be
contented to compound the business, <em>viz.</em> to sell at six and an
half; and if the difference be a more ragged fraction, men
under a long time will not apprehend it, nor ever be able exactly
to govern their practice according to it.</p>

<p>15. Secondly, Although I apprehend little real difference
between raising Forreign Money to double, and <ins class="corrx" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Erratum applied">abating</ins> half
in the price of our own Commodities, yet to <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'sell them on on a'">sell them on a</ins><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
tacite condition to be paid in Forreign present Money, shall
increase our money; forasmuch as between raising the money,
and abasing the price, is the same difference as between
selling for money and in barter, which latter is the dearer; or
between selling for present money, and for time; barter resolving
into the nature of uncertain time.</p>

<p>16. I say, suppose English Cloth were sold at six shillings a
Yard, and French Canvas at eighteen pence the Ell, the question
is, whether it were all one in order to increase Money in
<em>England</em> to raise the French Money double, or to abate half
of the price of our Cloth? I think the <ins class="corrx" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Erratum applied">former better</ins>, because that
former way or proposition carries with it a condition of having
Forreign Money in <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">specie</i>, and not Canvas in barter, between
which two wayes the world generally agrees there is a
difference. Wherefore if we can afford to abate half our
price, but will not do it but for our neighbours money, then
we gain so much as the said difference between Money and
Barter amounts unto, by such raising of our Neighbours
Money.</p>

<p>17. But the fundamental solution of this Question depends
upon a real and not an imaginary way of computing the prices
of Commodities; in order to which real way I premise
these suppositions: First then, suppose there be in a Territory
a thousand people, let these people be supposed sufficient to
Till this whole Territory as to the Husbandry of Corn,
which we will suppose to contain all necessaries for life, as in
the Lords Prayer we suppose the word Bread doth; and let
the production of a Bushel of this Corn be supposed of equal
labour to that of producing an ounce of Silver. Suppose
again that a tenth part of this Land, and tenth of the people,
viz. an hundred of them, can produce Corn enough for the
whole; suppose that the Rent of Land (found out as abovementioned)
be a fourth part of the whole product, (about
which proportion it really is, as we may perceive by paying a
fourth Sheaf instead of Rent in some places) suppose also
that whereas but an hundred are necessary for this Husbandry,
yet that two hundred have taken up the Trade; and suppose<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
that where a Bushel of Corn would suffice, yet men out of
delicacy will use two, making use of the Flower onely of
both. Now the Inferences from hence are;</p>

<p>First, That the goodness or badness, or the value of Land
depends upon the greater or lesser share of the product given
for it in proportion to the simple labour bestowed to raise the
said Product.</p>

<p>Secondly, That the proportions between Corn and Silver
signifie onely an artificial value, not a natural; because the
comparison is between a thing naturally useful, and a thing in
it self unnecessary, which (by the way) is part of the reason
why there are not so great changes and leaps in the <ins class="corrx" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Erratum applied">prices</ins>
of Silver as of other Commodities.</p>

<p>Thirdly, That natural dearness and cheapness depends
upon the few or more hands requisite to necessaries of Nature:
As Corn is cheaper where one man produces Corn for
ten, then where he can do the like but for six; and withall,
according as the Climate disposes men to a necessity of spending
more or less. But Political Cheapness depends upon the
paucity of Supernumerary Interlopers into any Trade over
and above all that are necessary, <em>viz.</em> Corn will be twice as
dear where are two hundred Husbandmen to do the same
work which an hundred could perform: the proportion thereof
being compounded with the proportion of superfluous
Expence, (<em>viz.</em> if to the cause of dearness abovementioned
be added to the double Expence to what is necessary) then
the natural price will appear quadrupled; and this quadruple
Price is the true Political Price computed upon naturall
grounds.</p>

<p>And this again proportioned to the common artificiall
Standard Silver gives what was sought; that is, the true Price
Currant.</p>

<p>18. But forasmuch as almost all Commodities have their
Substitutes or Succedanea, and that almost all uses may be
answered several wayes; and for that novelty, surprize, example
of Superiours, and opinion of unexaminable effects do
adde or take away from the price of things, we must adde<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
these contingent Causes to the permanent Causes abovementioned,
in the judicious foresight and computation whereof
lies the excellency of a Merchant.</p>

<p>Now to apply this Digression, I say, that to encrease Money,
it is as well necessary to know how to abate <ins class="corrx" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Erratum applied">as</ins> raise,
the price of Commodities, and that of Money, which was
the scope of the said Digression.</p>

<p>19. To conclude this whole Chapter, we say, that raising
or embasing of Moneys is a very pittiful and unequal way of
Taxing the people; and ’tis a sign that the State sinketh,
which catcheth hold on such Weeds as are accompanied with
the dishonour of impressing a Princes Effigies to justifie
Adulterate Commodities, and the breach of Publick Faith,
such as is the calling a thing what it really is not.</p>

<br />
<span class="chap-sum"><em>Of Excize.</em></span></h2>


<p class="drop-capy">It is generally allowed by all, that men should contribute
to the Publick Charge <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'but acccording to'">but according to</ins> the share and interest
they have in the Publick Peace; that is, according to
their Estates or Riches: now there are two sorts of Riches,
one actual, and the other potential. A man is actually and
truly rich according to what he eateth, drinketh, weareth, or
any other way really and actually enjoyeth; others are but
potentially or imaginatively rich, who though they have power
overmuch, make little use of it; these being rather Stewards
and Exchangers for the other sort, then owners for themselves.</p>

<p>2. Concluding therefore that every man ought to contribute
according to what he taketh to himself, and actually enjoyeth.
The first thing to be done is, to compute what the
Total of the Expence of this Nation is by particular men upon
themselves, and then what part thereof is necessary for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
the Publick; both which (no not the former) are so difficult
as most men imagine.</p>

<p>3. In the next place we must conceive, that the very perfect
Idea of making a Leavy upon Consumptions, is to rate
every particular Necessary, just when it is ripe for Consumption;
that is to say, not to rate Corn until it be Bread, nor
Wool until it be Cloth, or rather until it be a very Garment;
so as the value of Wool, Cloathing, and Tayloring, even to
the Thread and Needles might be comprehended; But this
being perhaps too laborious to be performed, we ought to
enumerate a Catalogue of Commodities both native and artificial,
such whereof accompts may be most easily taken, and
can bear the Office marks either on themselves, or on what
contains them; being withall such, as are to be as near Consumption
as possible: And then we are to compute what further
labour or charge is to be bestowed on each of them, before
consumption, that so an allowance be given accordingly.
As for example, suppose there be an hundred pounds
worth of Stript Stuff for Hangings, and an hundred pounds
worth of Cloth or Stuff for the best mens Cloathes; I conceive,
that the Cloth should bear a greater Excize then the
said stript stuff, the one wanting nothing but tacking up, to be
at its wayes end; and the other Tayloring, Thread, Silk, Needles,
Thimbles, Buttons, and several other particulars: The
Excise of all which must be accumulated upon the Excize of
the Cloth, unless they be so great (as perhaps Buttons, Lace,
or Ribbons may be) to be taxed apart, and inserted into the
Catalogue abovementioned.</p>

<p>4. Now the things to be accumulated upon Cloth are, as
near as possible, to be such particulars as are used onely to
Cloth, or very rarely to any other particular, as the several sorts
of peculiar trimmings; so on Corn should be accumulated
the charge of grinding, bolting, yeast, &amp;c. for the baking
of it into Bread, unless, as was said before, any of these particulars
can be better rated apart.</p>

<p>5. A Question ariseth hence, whether any Native Commodities
exported ought to pay the Excize, or that what is imported<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
in lieu of it should pay none? I answer no, because
they are not spent here <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">in specie</i>; but I conceive that the Goods
returned from abroad for them and spent here should pay, if
the exported have not already, for so shall what we spend pay
once, but not oftner. Now if Bullion be returned, then if it
be coyned into Money it ought not to pay, because Money
will beget other commodities which shall pay; but if the said
Bullion be wrought into Plate and Utensils, or disgrost into
Wire or Lace, or beaten into Fueilles, then it also ought to
pay, because it is consumed and absolutely spent, as in Lace
and Gilding is too notorious; and this is the reason why I
think the Leavy we commonly call Customs to be unseasonable
and preposterous, the same being a payment before consumption.</p>

<p>6. We have several times spoken of Accumulative Excize,
by which we mean Taxing many things together as one: As
for example, suppose the many Drugs used in Treacle or
Mithridate were used onely in those Compositions, in such
case by taxing any one of them, the whole number will be
taxed as certainly as that one, because they all bear a certain
proportion one to another: In Cloth, the Workmanship and
Tools as well as the Wool may be well enough taxed, &amp;c.</p>

<p>7. But some have strained this Accumulation so, as they
would have all things together taxed upon some one single
particular, such as they think to be nearest the Common Standard
of all Expence, the principal ends of their proposition
being these, <em>viz.</em></p>

<p>First, To disguise the name of Excize, as odious to them,
that do neither know the payment of Taxes to be as indispensable
as eating, and as have not considered the natural justice
of this way of Excizing or proportionating.</p>

<p>Secondly, To avoid the trouble and charge of Collecting.</p>

<p>Thirdly, To bring the business <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ad firmum</i>, and to a certainty
of all which we shall speak hereafter, when we examine the
several reasons for and against the way of Excize, proceeding
now to the several <em>species</em> of Accumulative Excizes propounded
in the world.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span></p>

<p>8. Some propound Beer to be the only Excizable Commodity,
supposing that in the proportion that men drink, they make
all other Expences; which certainly will not hold, especially
if Strong Beer pay quintuple unto, (as now) or any more
Excize then the small: For poor Carpenters, Smiths, Feltmakers,
&amp;c. drinking twice as much Strong Beer as Gentlemen
do of Small, must consequently pay ten times as much Excize.
Moreover, upon the Artizans Beer is accumulated, onely
a little Bread and Cheese, leathern Clothes, Neck-Beef, and
Inwards twice a week, stale Fish, old Pease without Butter, &amp;c.
Whereas on the other, beside Drink, is accumulated as many
more things as Nature and Art can produce; besides this
way of Excizing, though it be never so well administred, is
neither so equal nor so easie, nor so examinable as the simple
Poll-money before spoken of, which is also but an Accumulative
Excize.</p>

<p>9. What hath been propounded for Beer may be of Salt,
Fuel, Bread, &amp;c. and the Propositions would all labour under
the same Inconveniences; for some spend more, some less
of these Commodities; and sometimes Families (each whereof
are propounded to be farmed, without descending to individual
heads) are more numerous at sometimes then at others, according
as their Estates or other Interests shall wax or wane.</p>

<p>10. Of all the Accumulative Excizes, that of Harth-money
or Smoak-money seems the best; and that onely because
the easiest, and clearest, and fittest to ground a certain Revenue
upon; it being easie to tell the number of Harths, which
remove not as Heads or Polls do: Moreover, ’tis more easie
to pay a small Tax, then to alter or abrogate Harths, even
though they are useless and supernumerary; nor is it possible
to cover them, because most of the neighbours know them;
nor in new Building will any man who gives forty shillings for
making a Chimney be without it for two.</p>

<p>11. Here is to be noted, that a Harth-money must be but
small, or else ’twill be intolerable; it being more easie for a
Gentleman of a thousand pound <em>per annum</em> to pay for an hundred
Chimneys (few of their Mansion-Houses having more)<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
then for Labourers to pay for two. Moreover, if the Land-Lord
onely pay this Tax, then is it not an Accumulative Excize
for all, but a particular Excize upon but one onely Commodity,
namely Housing.</p>

<p>12. Now the Reasons for Excize are these, <em>viz.</em></p>

<p>First, The Natural Justice that every man should pay according
to what he actually enjoyeth; upon which account
this Tax is scarce forced upon any, and is very light to those,
who please to be content with natural Necessaries.</p>

<p><ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'Seondly, This Tax'">Secondly, This Tax</ins> if it be not farmed, but regularly collected,
engages to thrift, the onely way to enrich a Nation, as
by the Dutch and Jews, and by all other men, who have come
to vaste Estates by Trade, doth appear.</p>

<p>Thirdly, No man payes double or twice for the same thing,
forasmuch as nothing can be spent but once; whereas it is
frequently seen, that otherwise men pay both by the Rent of
their Lands, by their Smoaks, by their Titles, and by Customs,
(which all men do, though Merchants chiefly talk of it) they
also pay by Benevolence and by Tythes; whereas in this way
of Excize no man need pay but one way, nor but once, properly
speaking.</p>

<p>Fifthly, By this way an excellent account may be taken of
the Wealth, Growth, Trade, and strength of the Nation at
all times. All which Reasons do make not for particular compoundings
with <ins class="corrx" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Erratum applied">Families</ins>, nor for letting the whole to farm,
but for collecting it by special Officers, who having a full employment,
will not be a fourth of the charge of our present
many multiform Levies; for to put extraordinary trouble and
hazzard upon the Countrey Officers, is a sorer Taxing of
them, then to make them pay a small Reward unto practised
Persons to be their Substitutes. All which are the common
Objections against Excize.</p>

<p>13. I should here adde the manner of Collecting it, but I
refer this to the practice of <em>Holland</em>; and I might also offer how
men may be framed to be fit for this and other Publick Trusts,
as to be Cashiers, Store-keepers, Collectors, &amp;c. but I refer
this Enquiry unto a more ample and fit occasion.</p>

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
